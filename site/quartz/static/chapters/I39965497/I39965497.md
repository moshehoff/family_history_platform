## Early Life

Harry Hoffman (as he was known in Australia) was born 8th February, 1888  in in the village of Savran, Pedolia (nowadays PODILYA) Russia (Ukraine).

<div class="info-box">

**From Mal Hoffman's research (in 2005):** SAVRAN ODES'KA, UKRAINE (Lat 48 degrees 08' N Long 30 degrees 06' E). Located approximately 50km NE of Balta and 100km from border of Moldova.

</div>

Harry was the second son born to [Shimon](/profiles/Shimon-Meir-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8-Hochman) and [Bracha](/profiles/Bracha-Hochman).

<div class="citation-box">

**From Nate Hoffman's notes:**

Harry's parents fled Russia (as did Rachel's) carrying Harry as a babe in arms during the Pogroms of the Czars time (Alexander III 1881 – 1894 or Nicholas II 1894 – 1917)

</div>

<div class="info-box">

**Pogrom:** Russian term, originally meaning 'riot' that came to be applied to a series of violent attacks on Jews in Russia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Pogroms were few before the assassination of Alexander II in 1881; after that, with the connivance of, or at least without hindrance from, the government, there were many pogroms throughout Russia. Soldiers and police often looked on without interfering. These pogroms encouraged the first emigration of Russian Jews to the United States. After 1882 there were few pogroms until 1903, when there was an extremely violent three-day pogrom at Chisinau resulting in the death of 45 Jews. Although it has not been conclusively proved that the Czarist government organised pogroms, the government's anti-Semitic policies certainly encouraged them. After the abortive revolution of 1905, pogroms increased in number and violence. With the success of the Bolshevik Revolution, pogroms ceased in the Soviet Union; they were revived in Germany and Poland after Adolf Hilter attained power.

_See E.H. Judge, Easter in Kishinev: Anatomy of a Pogrom (1992) – Mal Hoffman._

</div>

They were taken to Rishon Le Zion. Both families dwelt there and raised their families.

<div class="info-box">

**Rishon Le Zion:** The fourth largest city in Palestine and 10 kilometers south and east of Tel Aviv Rishon Le Tzion, or the first of Zion, was founded in 1882 by a group of Russian settlers, and is credited with being the first modern agricultural settlement in Palestine (now known as Israel), hence the name.

Following [Bracha](/profiles/Bracha-Hochman)'s death, [Shimon](/profiles/Shimon-Meir-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8-Hochman) married [Frieda](/profiles/Frida-Hochman-Zisselman) Sisselman and they had five more children. (information received from [Nate Hoffman](/profiles/Nate-Hoffman))

<div class="citation-box">

**From [Nate](/profiles/Nate-Hoffman)'s notes:**

Apparently [Frieda](/profiles/Frida-Hochman-Zisselman) didn't like Harry and he ran away from home when he was about 11 years old. [Shimon](/profiles/Shimon-Meir-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8-Hochman) used some influence to get him a job working for a German engineering company that produced pumps and engines for wells. Harry trained as a fitter and turner.

## Marriage and Family

He met the red-headed [Rachel](/profiles/Ruchel-Hoffman-Gillik) (Roochle/Rachelle) Gilik (Hilik) who had also been carried out of Russia as a babe in arms and the couple were married 18th April, 1908 in Jaffa, Palestine by [Rav Avraham Kuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Isaac_Kook).

<div class="citation-box">

**From information given by [Nate Hoffman](/profiles/Nate-Hoffman) during a conversation with Mal, Terry and Marie Hoffman in 2005:**

In 1914 the family moved to Egypt where Harry looked after an olive crushing plant (which could also grind wheat into flour).

</div>

[Rachel](/profiles/Ruchel-Hoffman-Gillik) did not like Egypt as the food market stalls were run by Arabs and hence food preparation was not "kosher" – a basic Jewish requirement.

### Children

**Harry and Rachel had six children:**

## Notes on Name Changes

<div class="citation-box">

**A further interesting comment from Mal Hoffman:**

"The ticket for the ship's passage from Port Said to Fremantle in May 1915 was issued for Mr and Mrs Hochman plus 1 child 6 and 1 child 3.

Hochman became Hoffman,

Boruch became [Bruce](/profiles/Bruce-Boruch-Hoffman), Bentson became [Benjamin](/profiles/Ben-Benzion-Hoffman) (which are the names shown on their death certificates)

The father Herchel became Harry (which is shown on his death certificate).

We'll never know if this was a deliberate decision of Harry and Rachel to Anglicise their names to become more easily accepted in an 'Énglish' country or whether the clerk handling their immigration formalities (who may not have been a scholarly type) just wrote down the closest phonetic spelling he could get to what they said.

I have no record of dad ever being referred to as Bentson in Australia."
