## Moishe, Tobl and Wolfe from Savran to Fremantle

![[bios/I11052340/img_moishe.jpg]]

On leaving, Moishe gave his uniform to his brother [Sholem](/profiles/Sholem-Hochman) (who subsequently migrated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvannia.

**_related to Peter_**

_Since he took his uniform home he was clearly in the Army reserves liable to be called upon in time of emergency, and when he requested special dispensation to leave Russia._

_His army documents from 1908 clearly state that he was still subject to mobilization. He kept them to enable him to leave Russia, and they were still in his documents case on his demise._

Moishe's character – duty, selflessness, hard work, Jewish values, community pride and service, compassion for the poor and oppressed, and charity – was formed in the crucible of Savran.

In his years as a soldier he learned to be self sufficient, independent, and to seize opportunity as it presented itself.

In the army he also learned the Russian language; and doubtless, to hold his liquor. Even though he served a despotic regime that repressed and encouraged atrocities against his people, Moishe was always proud of his uniform and his years of soldiering.

_From 1895 to 1917, all Jewish emigration was handled in Kiev by the **Society for Adjustment of Jewish Emigration**, later called the Jewish Emigration Society. Its records survived and have recently been opened for study. The records dealing with the years 1907-1910 should be available on-line in the future._

_A ship sailed from Odessa every Saturday, to Constantinople, Smyrna, Beirut and Jaffa. The cost of travel was 55 roubles and 45 kopecks in 3rd class - no food and sleeping on deck._

_1st class – included cabin and food – cost 74 roubles and 95 kopecks._

_The ship anchored about one kilometre offshore, and the passengers were taken ashore to Jaffa in boats, which may be uncomfortable in rough weather but are quite safe._

**_ODESSA HARBOUR_**

Moishe's 17 years-old nephew [Wolfe](/profiles/Wolfe-Hochman) (the son of [Josef](/profiles/Josef-Hochman)), had been entrusted to his care and travelled with them. From Jaffa they went to Ramla, to be precise, to Sarafand al'Amar to visit his brother [Shimon Me'ir](/profiles/Shimon-Meir-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8-Hochman).

Sarafand al'Amar was an Arab village where a small number of Jewish families lodged. The site is today's Tzrifin. As in Ottoman Palestine there were few prospects, Moishe continued on to join his other brother, [Haim Yudl](/profiles/Haim-Yehuda-%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94-Hochman) and his nephew [Ber'l](/profiles/Berl-Hochman) (son of [Shimon Me'ir](/profiles/Shimon-Meir-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8-Hochman)) in Australia ([Haim Yudl](/profiles/Haim-Yehuda-%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94-Hochman) had arrived in Fremantle in 1901, [Ber'l](/profiles/Berl-Hochman) in 1904).

Their Russian passports were confiscated by the Ottoman authorities, and they received Turkish travel documents. They retained these latter documents on arriving in Australia.

**_NDL SCHARNHORST_**

They went to Port Said (probably by sea) and boarded the _Scharnhorst_ (Norddeutscher Lloyd), a German vessel out of Bremen bound for Australia. They travelled third class in steerage, which was a communal dormitory/living quarters shared by hundreds of poor passengers.

_The Scharnhorst of 8,130 tons was built in Geestemünde, Germany in 1904. The vessel plied the route Bremen – Antwerp – Southampton – Algiers - Genoa – Naples – Port Said – Aden – Colombo – Fremantle – Adelaide – Melbourne – Sydney. She was what is termed an emigrant ship. Most of the Jewish immigrants to Perth from Russia and from Palestine who came out before the Great War travelled in steerage on Norddeutscher ships._

**_The HOCHMAN ROUBLE_**

The Scharnhorst docked at Fremantle a few minutes after 11 a.m. on the 25.4.1910, the second day of Pesach י"ג באייר - פסח שני בחו"ל just two days before Moishe's twenty-sixth birthday (Gregorian date).

Moishe used to say that he arrived in Australia with only two shillings. The truth of the matter is he kept a Russian one rouble banknote to show that they were penniless.

They brought few personal possessions out of Russia.

Tubb'l had a samovar, and a porcelain tea service.

A single cup and a saucer have survived these hundred years.
