## Moishe In Russia
### Moishe and Tubb'l Hochman משה ויונה הוכמאן

Moishe was born in 1884 in Savran, in the guvernat of Podolia in the Russian Empire. From about 1920 the provinces were rearranged and Savran is now in the Odessa Oblast. Moishe was the eighth of the ten children of [Wolf](/profiles/Wolf-%D7%96%D7%90%D7%91-Hochman) and [Beile](/profiles/Beile-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%90-Hochman-Elizafan). The name Hochman is Yiddish for "tall."

Beile is a Yiddish girl's name, derived from the slavic “biela” meaning white. “Bella”, as her name has been recorded outside of Russia, is an italianate approximation.  

The children, as they were known by their Yiddish and Hebrew names were:

**_This list, in chronological order, was written by my aunt [Valda](/profiles/Valda-Marie-Hoffman-Levy)._**

Moishe's application for naturalization, filed in the **Australian National Archives** gives his birth date as the 15th of April 1884. This is most probably the Julian date, which corresponds to the 27th of April in the Gregorian calendar. באייר ב" יום

Bobka must be a nick-name. It may be derived from the Polish word for beans, via the Yiddish  word  bobkes (beans), which is also used to denote something small, trivial, insignificant....  in this case “our kid sister”.

_Savran was a small town on the bank of the Lower Bug River. Like may others in the area it had a large Jewish minority. Moishe used to say with pride that he came from Savran on the Bug._ (related to his grandson Peter)

**_PODOLIA GUVERNAT in 1884, SAVRAN marked in red._**

_His father, Wolf was timber merchant._ (related to Edith Hoffman)

We know no more about him. He died between the years 1890 and 1892 when Moishe was a child. His grave should be in the still existing Jewish cemetery in Savran.

We know this from Ashkenazi naming conventions. Sons receive the names of departed forebears. In November 1892, a grandson received the name Wolf.

His mother was  Beile Alzofen.  The name Alzofen is derived from Elitzafan.  It was the name of a cousin of Aharon and of Moshe אליצפן בן עוזיאל , a Levite, who took Aaron's sons Nadav and Avihu for burial.  ( Exodus 6:22   שמות).

As a family name it is very rare. I have found but one family – Alzofon (sic) – who came from Russia. They lived in Dubasari on the left bank of the Dneister, only fifty miles from Savran. They emigrated to the USA in 1906, and lived in Detroit, Michigan.

Their descendants now live in other states, and in Israel.

An account of the 1917 pogroms in Savran mentions Simon Elitzafan who was whipped by marauding Cossacks. The source, in Hebrew and with its English translation is appended at the end of this narrative.

_[Beile](/profiles/Beile-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%90-Hochman-Elizafan) came to Palestine and is buried on the Mount of Olives._ (related to his son [Hymie](/profiles/Hymie-Haim-Hoffman)) 

She must have arrived at the earliest in 1910, and passed away in 1915 at the latest. We know this because a grand daughter born in Perth in 1915 bore her name ([Bella](/profiles/Bella-Hoffman-Hochman)).

Until 1793, Podolia was part of the extensive Kingdom of Poland. Its Jewish population was about sixty thousand. Savran was in the Bratslav administrative district. In that year, in the second partition of Poland, Podolia became part of Tsarist Russia. Orthodox Russia now had a large Jewish population in her western lands, and dealt with the situation by  restricting them to the former Polish lands and formulating a great body of legislation pertinent and discriminatory to them. This area was known as the Pale of Jewish Settlement. Many of the shtetels of Podolia  were seminal to the development of hassidic Judaism - among them, Bratslav, Uman, Tulchin and Mezhibozh. The majority of the population was Ukrainian of the Orthodox Catholic persuasion. From childhood, in home and church, they were raised on antisemitism.

My father Hymie used to say: _"the Ukrainians imbibe their antisemitism with their mothers' milk"_. This appears to be a translation of a Yiddish saying which he learned from his parents.

From their bitter experience of the massacres of the seventeenth century, and later blood libels and persecutions, the Jews had learnt to fear them. Although the area we know as the Ukraine was agricultural, in the year 1897  80% of Jews lived in the towns, and comprised 34% of the urban population. Many towns had a Jewish majority. Most of the businessmen and merchants were Jews. In 1847 there were 165,000 Jews in Podolia; in 1881 there were 418,000.  According to the 1882 census for the purpose of specific Jewish taxation, there were 992 Jewish households in Savran. In 1900, even after the exodus of many families, the Jewish population of Savran totalled 3,198 persons.

From 1881 on, the lives of Russia's Jews were shocked by a series of tragic events. Moishe Hochman was born in those terrible times.  As a child and youth he experienced  persecution and witnessed brutality. The subsequent family history was shaped by those events, hence they are herein described at some length.

In the year 1881, following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, a wave of pogroms, unknown in their intensity for more than two hundred years, swept through southwest Russia, of which Podolia was a province.

It is noteworthy that the brunt of the massacres carried out by various governments, militias and lawless factions between 1882 and 1921 was borne by the communities of  our ancestral  towns, Bershad, Savran, and many others in Podolia.

In August 1911, [Haim Yudl](/profiles/Haim-Yehuda-%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94-Hochman) was interviewed by reporters of the _Sunday Times_ newspaper in Perth in connection with a police investigation in that city (into a man named as Peter the Painter):
<div class="citation-box">
"You are not in Russia here. In this country if a man is arrested he is brought before the court within 24 hours, but not so in Russia. There you may be arrested and it may be five or six years before you even see the charge on which you were apprehended.

I have a case in the Warsaw paper here in which a man was arrested in 1905, and he has only just been brought before the court and sent to Siberia. You have no conception of the difference between British and Russian law.

Twenty-seven years ago I saw enough to prove to me that Russia was a pretty good place to get away from, and I have no wish to see it again."
</div>

By a simple calculation [Haim Yudl](/profiles/Haim-Yehuda-%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94-Hochman), as a eighteen year-old in 1884 (the very year of Moishe's birth), was referring to pogroms that he had witnessed in Savran.  Haim Yudl's actual words wouldn't have been so grammatical or literary, but the message is clear. 

On May 3(15),1882, Alexander III  approved antisemitic regulations. They are generally known as the May Laws.

They read as follows:

1. As a temporary measure, and until a general revision is made of their legal status, it is decreed that the Jews be forbidden to settle anew outside of towns and boroughs, exceptions being made only in the case of existing Jewish agricultural colonies.

2. Temporarily forbidden are the issuing of mortgages and other deeds to Jews, as well as the registration of Jews as lessees of real property situated outside of towns and boroughs; and also the issuing to Jews of powers of attorney to manage and dispose of such real property.

3. Jews are forbidden to transact business on Sundays and on the principal Christian holy days; the existing regulations concerning the closing of places of business belonging to Christians on such days to apply to Jews also.

Other May Law regulations placed severe quotas on the admission of Jewish students to high schools and to universities, and denied Jews the right to practice certain professions, to become share holders in stock companies, hold administrative positions in such companies, and so on.... 

These temporary regulations were never repealed. As intended, they made life in the Pale unbearable. Jews were further restricted in domicile, education and business. State-instigated violence, carried out by military units and armed hordes, Cossacks and others, became a fact of life. During Pesach 1882, there were pogroms in Balta and in the surrounding towns of Podolia.  After 1882, the Zionist movement in Russia, Poland and Lithuania grew, and a mass exodus of Jews from the Russian Empire began. The years 1903 to 1906 were notable for another wave of pogroms in the Odessa area. By 1920 more than two million Russian Jews had fled. The vast majority went to the United States; many to England, Ireland and South Africa, and to other countries including Australia. About thirty thousand went to Ottoman Palestine. This minority that  arrived in Palestine, who  were  known as the First Aliya, were ideologists committed to rebuilding the land of Zion. Those who arrived after the Kishinev pogrom of 1903 were the Second Aliya.

As a child, Moishe saw his eldest brother [Shimon Me'ir](/profiles/Shimon-Meir-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8-Hochman) and his family depart for Palestine in 1890. He saw the next eldest [Haim Yudl](/profiles/Haim-Yehuda-%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94-Hochman) and his wife leave for Palestine about 1892.

Children in the shtetels were educated in Jewish schools  which were supported by a special tax levied on the communities. They  learned Torah, and the prayer services from their elders and rabbis in the heder and in shule.  religious classes and synagogue).

_Moishe witnessed pogroms in Savran. He saw mounted troops with swords decapitating Jews._ (related to his grandson Trevor David)

_His sister [Bobka](/profiles/_Bobka_-Hochman) met her death in the river during a pogrom._ (related to [Edith](/profiles/Edith-%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%9C-Hoffman-Spielmann))

_He witnessed a public execution by hanging._ (related to [Edith](/profiles/Edith-%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%9C-Hoffman-Spielmann))

These childhood experiences were what the repressive Tsarist regime offered in lieu of school lessons in social studies.

_Like most Jews in Podolia, the family was observant. There were of course miscreants. One of [Wolf](/profiles/Wolf-%D7%96%D7%90%D7%91-Hochman)'s daughters-in-law walked out because her husband smoked on shabbat._ (related to [Edith](/profiles/Edith-%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%9C-Hoffman-Spielmann))

At home they spoke only Yiddish. As the towns had 40%-60% Jewish inhabitants, and much of the commerce was in Jewish hands, they had little use for the Ukrainian language. The men, who travelled and traded must have known it, but the women hardly at all. Yiddish was the language that they took with them when they emigrated, and remained for most the language of day to day life, the only tongue that they ever knew well. Yiddish was the language of their letters, and of the annotations on the backs of their few photographs. Marriages were contracted (shiddochs), frequently with families from other shtetels.

_Moishe learned the craft of the cartwright and wheelwright. The family would construct then sell a cart in the market, and with the revenue buy a log of wood to be sawn up for another cart._ (related to his son [Jack](/profiles/Jack-Hoffman))

Much later, in Perth Moishe repaired metal pub garden furniture, and barrels. In his spare time he did many of the repair jobs at the Brisbane St. shule. A steel laminex-topped table he made for [Edith](/profiles/Edith-%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%9C-Hoffman-Spielmann) was in our home in Yokine. [Hymie](/profiles/Hymie-Haim-Hoffman) told of seeing his father throwing a hot iron hoop around the sawn elements of a wooden wheel.

### The Tsarist army

About 1906 Moishe was conscripted into the Tsarist army. The terms of service were changed several times during the 19th and 20th centuries.  Immediately before the outbreak of World War I, the Imperial Government imposed compulsory service of three years for entrants to infantry and artillery regiments and four years for cavalry and engineers.

After completing this initial period of full-time service, conscripts passed into the first class reserves for seven years. The final obligation for compulsory service ended at age 43, after eight years in the second reserves. _Moishe’s_ army service document  suggests that his mandatory service was for three years,  and thereafter service in the first and second class reserves.

### This article came in from Lane Igoudin:

<div class="citation-box">
After 1905, the position of the Jewish soldiers in the army became precarious. Between 1906 and 1914, far-right ideologues argued in the Duma that all Jews were traitors, cowards, and useless soldiers who corrupted Russia through socialist propaganda. Hence, it was claimed, the army would benefit from banishing Jews from its ranks. A questionnaire, distributed by the War Ministry in 1911–1912, manifested a significant degree of anti-Jewish sensibility among the highest echelons of army commanders, who subscribed to far-right arguments. Books such as M. Usov’s (Moisei Trivus) _Evrei v armii_ (Jews in the Army; 1911), the anonymous _Voina i evrei_ (War and Jews; 1912), and Saul Ginsburg’s _Velikaia otechestvennaia voina 1812 goda i russkie evrei_ (The Patriotic War of 1812 and Russian Jews; 1912) that testified to Jewish patriotism, good service, and excellent combat performance, as well as the ardent apologetics articulated by liberal-minded Duma members, could hardly check the wave of anti-Jewish slander in Russian society. However, the war ministry showed a certain level of pragmatism and did not yield to the arguments of far-right politicians. The 1912 Statute of the War Ministry confirmed Jewish eligibility for military duty, although it also approved and legalized all anti-Jewish regulations that had been adopted in the 1880s and 1890s.

The 1912 Statute had little impact on some 300,000 Jews who served in the Russian army during [World War I](https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/World_War_I "World War I"). Despite a vociferous anti-alien campaign that blamed Russian military failures on Jews in general and on the Jewish population inhabiting [Galicia](https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Galicia) in particular, Jewish soldiers (as military censors reported) shared patriotic enthusiasm with their Russian parallels. Responding to an obviously biased general questionnaire in 1915 about Jewish traitors, deserters, and cowards within the lower ranks, regimental commanders replied that Jews “by and large fulfilled their military duty satisfactorily,” participated in combat “on par with others,” and “did not differ either positively or negatively from other lower ranks.” Russian military memoirs portrayed Jewish soldiers as excellent telegraphers, gun layers, and scouts. To fight the antisemitic bias of Russian high commanders, [Maksim Gorky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Gorky) and [Leonid Andreev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Andreyev) compiled a collection of stories and poetry, _Shchit_ (The Shield; 1916), depicting the honesty and courage of Jewish soldiers, sharply criticizing the inherited bias of the Russian society, and arguing for complete Jewish emancipation.

After the [February Revolution of 1917](https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Russian_Revolutions_of_1917 "Russian Revolutions of 1917"), the provisional government canceled all anti-Jewish regulations in the military, allowing upper mobility to the Jews and opening the doors of officers’ schools to them. Perhaps the disproportionate number of Jews in the highest positions in the Red Army command signified that Jews tended to recompense themselves for the hundred years of service in the Russian army on the lower rank level; that they mastered the military craft and did not shun it; and that they viewed the military as a focal tool for achieving privileges denied them in a nonliberal society.
</div>
#### From [https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/military_service_in_russia](https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/military_service_in_russia):
>A disproportionate number of young Jewish men were conscripted. They served as  rank and file infantry and artillerymen.  Commissions were denied them. In the history of the Imperial Army only about four  ever  became officers. One of them,  [Yosef Trumpeldor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Trumpeldor) was commissioned in recognition of his valour  in the Russo Japanese War.  He later achieved  fame for his exploits at Gallipoli and in Palestine.

_Moishe, however, served in his trade of wheelwright._ (related to [Jack](/profiles/Jack-Hoffman))

As the army depended on horse and mule-drawn wagons and gun carriages, he was fortunate that he had that craft. The Jewish soldiers were religiously observant as best they could.  

_Moishe did not eat pork. Before Pesach they baked matzot._ (related to [Hymie](/profiles/Hymie-Haim-Hoffman))

_Each soldier had a wooden spoon which he stuck down his high leather boot (see photo). Meals came in a large cooking pot. The men would gather around and dip in._ (related to Peter)

**_1909 Moishe (on the right in the dark uniform) with a fellow soldier, whom I believe to be a relative named Moishe Rosenzvit, who resembles him._**

_Moshe was sent far to the east arriving in Vladivostok in 1906 after the cessation of hostilities in the Russo-Japanese War._ (related to [Jack](/profiles/Jack-Hoffman))

_The war is considered to have lasted until the 5.9.1905. He told of crossing Lake Baikal by ferry._ (related to Peter)

As a young man from the plains of Russia, he had never seen the sea. Lake Baikal in its mountainous setting made a lasting impression. Baikal is the jewel of Siberia, today its greatest tourist attraction.

![[bios/I11052340/img_lake_baikal.png]]
**_Lake Baikal_**

Fortuitously, in April 1942, during the Second World War, he gave an interview to the _Sunday Times_ newspaper, and thus we know certain details, and of a remarkable incident:
<div class="citation-box">
A well known Perth publican was once a Czarist soldier in Russia serving with a battalion of shock troops in Siberia.  As a young man in his teens Morris was the equivalent of a private in the Czarist ranks at a time when the last flickers of the Russian-Japanese conflagration were dying out. But bloodshed was no uncommon thing, even in this period of semi-peace. What with pogroms, revolutionary uprisings and provincial flare-ups the life of a young Czarist soldier was far from uneventful. 

Morris spent six months in garrison in Vladivostok and then saw service in different centres, in one of which he was an eye-witness to the assassination of the local military commandant. The victim was not popular with the masses nor with his soldiers. One morning everyone was issued with a leaflet advising the the commandant was to be killed at 5 p.m. that day. Naturally the commandant received news of his approaching demise, but accepted it with the proverbial grain of salt.  But two bullets thudded into his back at 5.05 p.m, just after he had shaken hands with the adjutant in the street. Morris Hoffman saw the whole incident. Next morning a communique of the revolutionary court apologised for the five-minute delay in the execution. 

Siberia was seething with revolt at the time, but Morris said that more blood was shed in the much more frequent pogroms. He was far from depressed when his release from the army arrived and he was free to travel abroad, his journeys eventually bringing him to W.A.
</div>

<div class="info-box">

**Comment:** The Russo-Japanese war started on 5.2.1904. The last major engagement was the naval battle of Tsushima on 27.5.1905. "The last flickers" would be the period after this event leading up to the Treaty of Portsmouth, signed on 5.9.1905 (Gregorian calendar), which formally ended the war.

_On one occasion, he and a fellow soldier went into town in Moishe's words "to find some women". They were absent without leave for two days. On returning they were apprehended (by a noncom?) coming in through the fence. He told them that he should report them to their officer for trial, but as he (himself) was a Bolshevik, he didn't care what happened in the army._ (related to Peter) 

_Moishe was in the far east when the date of his discharge was approaching. He asked his officer to effectuate it because he was serving thousands of miles from home at the end of the long railway. The reply was: "Zhid, you're not going anywhere."_ (related to Peter)

In Russian this sentence would be a marvellous double negative: _"Zhid, you're not going nowhere"_

_His mother, [Beile](/profiles/Beile-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%90-Hochman-Elizafan), petitioned the Tsarina, Alexandra, for his release._ (related to [Edith](/profiles/Edith-%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%9C-Hoffman-Spielmann))  

This was Alexandra, grand daughter of Queen Victoria of England and consort of  Tsar Nikolai II.  Nikolai was the last Tsar. He abdicated in 1917. Alexandra, Nikolai,  their four daughters _and son were subsequently murdered by the Bolsheviks.

How the petition was handled, we will never know; however it is certain that Moishe did serve longer than the mandatory period.  He was finally discharged in 1909, “when his release from the army arrived".

Moishe's personal file is somewhere in the Russian archives. To find it we would have to know his regiment. However, from the few clues we have we can make some assumptions about his movements.                                         

His account of crossing Baikal by ferry is consistent with the historical facts (an account of the Transsiberian railway and the Baikal ferries is appended to this biography). While the train ferry _Baikal_ was destroyed long ago, the passenger ferry _Angara_ was in service until 1962. She was then left to rust until 1989. She is now at dockside in the Transsiberian Museum at the port of Listvyanka, 70 kilometers from Irkutsk. Moishe probably crossed the lake on the passenger deck of the _Baikal_.

![[bios/I11052340/img_railroad_map.png]]
**_Map of the Asian section of the Transsiberian railroad and ferry._**

His life had taught him that there was no future for him in Russia. On returning from the army he married a young woman from another town in Podolia – [Tubb'l Zitzerman](/profiles/Tobl-Hochman-%28Hoffman%29-Zitserman) from Bershad – and got out of Russia. The marriage, as was usual at that time was probably arranged. His goal was Perth in Western Australia, where his brother [Haim Yudl](/profiles/Haim-Yehuda-%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94-Hochman) had settled.
