**Comment:** The list was prepared by Sheffens, the assistant purser. His passenger lists confirm to the way a German national would spell the names. They show that Moishe knew that his family in Australia had adopted the name Hoffman. His brother [Hyam Hoffman](/profiles/Haim-Yehuda-%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94-Hochman) was already using the name Hoffman in 1904. Sheffens has mistakenly written **W.** Hoffman for **M.** Hoffman (should be [Moshe](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman)), and **M.** Hoffman for **W.** Hoffman (should be [Wolfe](/profiles/Wolfe-Hochman)).

The above listed seven youngsters were the only Jews on the boat. The nationality "Austrien" indicates that the last four were from Galicia, the easternmost province of the Austrian Empire. The truth is somewhat different....

According to the the Zines family history: Mark was the second of his brothers and sisters to immigrate to Perth, Western Australia and at that time he changed his surname from Zines to Morris. Mark had learned tailoring in Safed. In Australia he started by hawking door to door, ladies ware. He then started a sack manufacturing business and later began manufacturing ladies clothing. Mark had many business interests. Mark's elder brother Charles "Charlie" Zines changed his name from Zines to Morris to effect immigration sponsorship by Solomon Morris (Solomon Morris in Perth had married a Zines) when this part of the Zines family immigrated to Australia via Fremantle. Charlie was a partner in the clothing and hessian bagging business (Morris & Co.) with his brother Mark.

The Morris boys, like their parents, were born in Safed in Ottoman Palestine. Their nationality was Turkish, and as Asiatics would not normally be admitted to Australia. At some point they "changed their name" and changed their nationality (bought or forged papers) to effect their immigration.

Mark Morris was to be the father of Geoff Morris.

[Louise (Cohen) Hoffman](/profiles/Louise-Hoffman-Cohen) – in 1910 not yet on the scene – is a second cousin of Mark.

They all disembarked at Fremantle. The Shapiras adopted the Sharp in Western Australia.

They are all members of the Zines family.

[Moishe](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman) and [Tobl](/profiles/Tobl-Hochman-%28Hoffman%29-Zitserman) and [Wolfe](/profiles/Wolfe-Hochman) must have made seder pesach with them somewhere in the Indian Ocean, two days before their landfall.
