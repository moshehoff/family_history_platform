## The Trans-Siberian Railroad & Lake Baikal

The Trans-Siberian Railroad, from Saint Petersburg to Vladivostok was a project of Tsar Alexander III. Work was commenced in 1895, and except for two sections the line was completed by 1900, and regular train services commenced.

Until  the Circumbaikal Railway was built and entered service in October 1905, the railheads on the east and west banks of the lake were linked by train ferry.  An ice-breaking train ferry, the _Baikal_, of 4,250 tons, was ordered from the Armstrong Whitworth  shipyard in Newcastle, England. She was transported in pieces by train from

St Petersburg to the port of Listvyanka on the lake, where she was assembled in 1899. The vessel was the largest of her kind ever built. She carried 24 wagons  plus a locomotive on three parallel rails on her  middle deck. The vessel tied up to the dock stern-first and the train was shunted on.

On the upper deck there was accommodation for 150 passengers.

A second ice-breaker, the _Angara_, built in the same shipyard, carried passengers only, and was in service with the _Baikal_. Together (in file), the two ships crossed Baikal in four hours, and made two return journeys daily. The _Baikal_ could crush four foot-thick ice; but as the ice became thicker, she slowed, and for a period from January to April the ships were tied up in port. At these times the passage across the hard ice was by horse-drawn carriages.

As these engineers' blueprints show the _Baikal_ was unique. The longitudinal section shows one of the three rows of railway carriages middecks. The transverse section to the right shows their disposition in relation to the stacks leading up to the funnels. The ice-breaking bow is on the left. She had a pair of drive shafts at her stern for the twin screws, and another pair at her bow.

The Circumbaikal Line, laid along precipitous mountainsides to skirt the lake by the south, was an engineering feat, requiring 200 bridges, 39 tunnels and numerous galleries to protect against landslides. It was opened for service in October 1905. Even after this date, the Baikal ferries operated whenever landslides obstructed the railway around the lake. St Petersburg and Vladivostok were finally  connected by iron when the Amur River was bridged in 1916.

During the the Russo Japanese War (Feb 1904 – Sept 1905), this single-line Trans-Siberian railway with its interposed ice-breaker train ferry was the only supply line to the theatre of war, and hence a major reason that the Russian war effort could not be maintained.
