## Tobl Zitserman

[Tubb'l](/profiles/Tobl-Hochman-%28Hoffman%29-Zitserman) was one of six children of Aaron and Elke Zitserman of Bershad. Her name Tubb'l is the Yiddish diminutive for a dove. She also lived through the pogroms, and her childhood was very hard. At the age of nine years she worked with her sisters as a seamstress. Bershad was a centre of woollen tallith (prayer shawl) weaving. She learned tallith making too and later in Perth she tailored tallitot for her family and grandchildren.

Aaron died sometime before 1912, as [Harry Aaron](/profiles/Aaron-Harry-%D7%90%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F-Hoffman) received his name. 

The family name Zitserman (or Zaitserman) is derived from the Yiddish root "zits" - "to sit". A zaitser is a rabbinical court judge, or dayan; as he is one who sits in judgement on a panel, or on a bench in a court.

According to Leah Dzienciol his son Yakov was a dayan in Bershad.

**The children of Aaron and Elke were:**

I haven't found any period photos of Bershad. During the Second War it became an internment camp for Jews from the surroundings and from Moldava. Apart from a synagogue, all communal property was destroyed. The appended photos of the extant synagogue are from about 2006.
