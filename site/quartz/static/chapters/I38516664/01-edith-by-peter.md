## Edith's Biography by peter
### The Spielmann Home

The Spielmann home, where she was born was at Zwolfergasse 9 Wien XV. Quite near the Westbahnof train station.

To find their home, enter the building and ascend one flight of steps, then turn left. It is the second door in that passage. All that remains today are the sets of nail holes in the door frame where Eduard affixed the mezzuzah.

The Wesbahnhof was the departure station for those travelling to France and the Channel Ports and later the assembly site for many deportations to Theresienstadt, and of the Kindertransports to England. It was bombed and gutted to a shell by the Allies; rebuilt and again became a major station. However, since 2015, with the exception of Salzburg it handles only local rail traffic. It was bombed and gutted to a shell by the Allies; rebuilt and again became a major station.

### Early Life

Edith was born on 27th November, the first of her generation born into a new Europe. On 11th November the Great War ended. In the west an armistice was signed. [Emperor Karl of Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_Austria) resigned the same day. The great empire was no more. She was much younger than her siblings - an afterthought. As such, she admits to receiving a lot of attention from all.

She attended the Victoriagasse primary school in Wien 1016, and the family's shule at Turnergasse in Funfhaus. Her childhood was very happy, marked by family visits and functions, and visits to the Viennese palaces, museums and the opera, and to the countryside where she learned to swim, to skate and to ski.

Her secondary schooling was at the prestigious Albertgasse Realgymnasium in Wien 1019. There her studies were supplemented by instruction by Rabbi Salomo Rappaport and Rabbi Manfred Papo in Hebrew and religion. Edith's grades in all subjects were exemplary and her future seemed assured.

Edith then studied at the Sprachschule Kautezki to study languages.

### The Anschluss

This quiet life came to an abrupt end when the German Army entered Austria on 12.3.1938. It was met without resistance, welcomed by most citizens. On the 15th, Edith went to the home of Eva Lessing, a girl of her own age whom she had tutoured. Eva's father was wealthy, and their home was on an upper floor on the Ringstrasse opposite the Wiener Opera. The Nazis staged a great parade along the Ringstrasse. Edith and Eva hid behind the curtains and peered out, afraid that someone might see the two Jewish girls. The saw [Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) pass to the wild ecstasy of the crowds. Hitler addressed the cheering crowds in the nearby Heldenplatz in the Hofburg. Edith and Eva were emotionally shattered by the experience. From that day, the young people who had been her friends no longer acknowledged her. Eva Lessing went to Vancouver and became Eva Reif. Adolf (Avi) Bauer, Edith's second cousin from Innsbruck was coincidentally in the throngs right opposite the Staatsoper. He related to me that when Hitler's open car passed, he caught the Fuhrer's eye and waved to him. The wave was returned to the Jewish lad.

Eva Lessing went to Vancouver, and became Eva Reif.

Helga completed a law degree andafter the war married her long-time boyfiend Uri Mittelberger, a vet. They lived in Alberschwende, a village above Dornbirn in the Voralberg Province.

Avi Bauer came to Palestine. He enlisted in the Jewish Brigade and served in Cyprus and Italy and eventually in the Netherlands. He became an officer in the regular army.

### Escape from Austria

Her family then had to search for the means to escape Austria. The streets were unsafe, so her father would not let her go out. He himself went from office to office to queue up to obtain the necessary documents and affadavits. Kaethe, Edith's sister, was one of those abused by Nazi thugs and forced to kneel on the pavements and scrub them with a toothbrush.

Edith's cousin Kurt Hönigsberg had emigrated to Melbourne in 1937. He worked in leathergoods manufacture for Phineas (Pinchas) Posner. When Phineas came to Wien in 1938 Edith was his interpreter. Kurt Honigsberg had recommended her to accompany him and to translate. Phineas subsequently went to Germany and experienced the plight of German Jewry. After his experience of antisemitism in Germany he returned to Australia and applied to sponsor Kurt's parents and Edith.

Edith in the company of her Onkel Heinrich and Tante Josephina. entered Italy at Tarvisio, on 30.9.1938.

At 0100 hours on that same day [Chamberlain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain), [Daladier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Daladier), [Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) and [Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini) signed the Munich agreement, ceding the Sudetenland to Germany. The Spielmann ancestral towns of Mikulov and Pohorelice and Breclav are within that territory.

### Journey to Australia

They continued on by rail to Genoa and on the 5.10.1938 they sailed from Genova. on the MN Viminale (Lloyd Triestino) via Messina, Catania, Port Said, Massawa (Italian Eritrea), Cochin and Colombo to Australia. We have the original ticket which shows that Edith and her uncle and aunt shared a third class cabin which was formally destined for two persons. The boarding passengers were innoculated against smallpox in compliance with the Australian regulations.

Edith related that as she had studied Latin at school for seven years she understood much of the crew's conversation. She then decided to learn Italian, and so would go upstairs to sit in the first class lounge. The crew acceded to this intrusion.

Her interest and talent for languages was remarkable. Her knowledge of English, and English vocabulary and usage was impeccable. She retained much of her knowledge of both French and Latin, though she had little use for them. Later she went to Adult Education Italian classes and perfected her skills in that tongue. For many years her little group of about six women met in one another's homes, to study together. It is no secret that Edith was the de facto tutor. Her love of the Italian language, culture and people had been nutured on the Viminale. One year Edith was on the staff of the Adult Education Department as an Italian teacher. She also helped some Italian migrants learn English.

The ship berthed in Fremantle on 8.11.1938, then Adelaide and at Melbourne on 16.11.1938 where the trio disembarked. Her first home was the Posner's her sponsor. Posner had three daughters, and Edith was not comfortable there. Her first job was with Benny Cohen, maritime insurer who was an agent for Lloyds of London. Her task was to calculate the insurance levied on the vessels plying the ocean of the world. This was a complicated business as it included details of cargo manifests and the war zones a ship would enter. Edith related that the other girls in the office couldn't manage with the variable rates and formulae and depended on her. Until October 1942 Edith was an enemy alien so it is an enigma how she worked with such sensitive data. Edith was at Benny Cohen's until she left for Perth, and her reference from him is incomparablel.

The MN Viminale was requisitioned by the Italian Navy, and served as a supply and troops ship in the Mediterranean She was finally sunk by an American torpedo boat in the Straits of Messina in July 1943. Edith told me about this so I researched it and wrote to the woman scuba diver who had found her on the ocean bed and had written a lovely illustrated book about her, which I asked to buy. On reading my letter she was touched and sent Edith the book as a present with her own free-hand dedication. Edith in turn, was overjoyed to receive it, showed it to her friends (only a few months before her death in Perth) and wrote a warm letter of appreciation

### Family Reunion and Marriage

During the war years her mother, her sister Kaethe and her brother Karl also arrived in Australia. Some other cousins also arrived in Melbourne, sponsored by Kurt Hönigsberg Hilton who by the volume of his applications was tirelessly active in his efforts to save lives. One day Edith saw that a businessman, [Laser Haimson](/profiles/Les-Lazar-Haimson), had advertised for a milliner. Edith went to his residence and asked him to sponser a girlfriend in Wein. Laser was a son of my father [Hymie](/profiles/Hyman-Judah-Hoffman)'s first cousin [Leah](/profiles/Leah-%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94-Hochman). There is no way of knowing today, but I suspect that the girl was Gerda Hönigsberg in Wien. Gerda eventually arrived in Birmingham. Her entire family was lost in the holocaust, and she herself had no children. However, [Hymie](/profiles/Hyman-Judah-Hoffman) was boarding at the Haimson's, so this is the story of how Mum and Dad met. !!!!!

Soon afterwards the Second War broke out. [Hymie](/profiles/Hyman-Judah-Hoffman) completed his degree and was conscripted as a medical officer. Edith came to Perth and they were married on 6.10.1942 by rabbi Louis Rubin- Zacks The wedding breakfast was held at the King George V hall in William St (now Northbridge).
