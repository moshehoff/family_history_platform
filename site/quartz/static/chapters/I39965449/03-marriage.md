## Berl's Marriage (1908)

### An Arranged Marriage

In 1908 Berl received a telegram from a Mrs Swartz advising him that [Rivka](/profiles/Rivka-Hochman-Zisselman), his wife-to-be, had arrived in Perth, and that she would arrange the wedding. The union had been arranged by Berl's father, and the bride's parents in Palestine.

### The Sisselman Connection

The widower [Shimon Me'ir](/profiles/Shimon-Meir-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8-Hochman) had remarried in Palestine. His wife [Frida](/profiles/Frida-Hochman-Zisselman) was the daughter of Rabbi Ya'akov Zvi and Mina Sisselman. Thus Berl was to marry the youngest sister of his own father's wife.

The Sisselman family came from Pinsk in Bielorussia. Rabbi Zisselman (1841-1923) was a founder of Hovevei Zion (a Zionist society devoted to the return to Israel) in Pinsk. They arrived in Palestine via Odessa in the year 1886, and commenced farming in Petach Tikva. Afterwards he settled in Jaffa, and was active in the Jewish community there, where he was a gabbai (beadle) of the Sukkat Shalom synagogue in Neveh Shalom. He wrote Tiferet Yisrael, a book of bible commentary.

Mrs Swartz made the wedding frock and the couple were duly married in 1908 in the Perth Synagogue. Berl and Rivka then returned to Wickepin.
