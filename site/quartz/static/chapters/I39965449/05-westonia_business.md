## Berl's Westonia Business (1913-1921)

### The Town of Westonia

<div class="info-box">

Westonia is a small town located in the Eastern Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. Located 316 kilometres east of Perth, 306 kilometres west of Kalgoorlie and 55 kilometres east of Merredin, 6 miles north of the Great Eastern Highway. 

Westonia came into existence with the discovery in 1910 of gold in the area. Initially the area was known as Weston's Reward and later as Westons. By 1915 there were two major mines in the area, and the population was in excess of 500. By 1917 the area, by then known as Westonia, had a population of more than 2,000. In 1919, low gold prices forced the closure of the mines, and many people left the area.

They lived in the house which was joined to the back of the shop on stumps. Behind the house was a high shed and then a large ice chest which housed approx 2-3 tons of ice, and alongside this was the workshop/storeroom for preparing cooldrinks etc., and then the stables which consisted of 5 stalls. The buildings were built on a gradual slope with the shop facing the street, and backed onto a lane.

The business in Westonia grew, and eventually also sold chaff and grain, and fish brought from Perth. It produced all the cool drinks for the town, and supplied ice which was sent by rail from an iceworks Perth to the siding at Carrabin, 7 miles from Westonia, where the family went to pick it up.

### Third Child

The second son, [Hymie (Hayem) Yudl](/profiles/Hymie-Haim-Hoffman) was born in Perth in 1913. Rivka returned to Westonia after her confinement.

### Uncle Haym's Death and Business Transfers (1914)

Berl's uncle [Haym](/profiles/Haim-Yehuda-Hoffman) had prospered in Perth. He had an Australian wine licence, and he leased the wine salon at 411 Wellington Street, Perth, where he lived with his family and ran the Westralia Fruit Palace. Haym planned to transfer the lease to his family and return to Palestine. However on 16.1.1914, the day before sailing, he died suddenly in the Supreme Court Gardens. 

His widow [Sarah](/profiles/Sara-Hochman-Bershada) who did return to Palestine, through the agency of the lawyer Morris Crawcour, transferred the lease to Berl on 24.2.1914. Berl and his Uncle [Morrie](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman) (my grandfather) were in partnership there for a year. 

On 8.3.1915 the "partnership" was dissolved, and Berl applied for a "transfer of the rights and privileges of the Australian Wine Licence held by me in respect of the said premises to [Morris Hoffman](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman) of 411 Wellington St. Perth, fruiterer". The reason for these transfers was that in 1914 Morrie held only a fruiterer's licence, so Berl temporarily stood in for him. Morrie and family lived on the premises and ran it for the absentee licensee.

### Fourth Child

[Rivka](/profiles/Rivka-Hochman-Zisselman)'s fourth child, [Hannah Beile](/profiles/Hanna-Beile-%D7%97%D7%A0%D7%94-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%A2-Miller-Hochman) was born in Perth in 1917. She returned with her to Westonia immediately afterwards.

### Jury Service

As an indication of Berl's capabilities, in 1921 he served as foreman of the jury at an inquest in Westonia.

On Friday the Deputy Coroner at Westonia, Mr. David Small, J.P., and a jury consisting of Messrs. Boris Hoffman (foreman), Arthur Rodgers, and Denny Kelly heard evidence respecting the death of William Stack, a farmer on the west side of the Rabbit Proof Fence, 20 miles west of Westonia. 

The evidence showed that Stack journeyed into Westonia on the day of his death and on the return journey was thrown from a light spring cart owing to the horse starting suddenly, dislodging the occupant and the seat.

The jury's verdict was: "That William Stack came to his death through shock followed by hemorrhage, caused by accidentally falling from a cart at Mr. Hodgins' place at 6 p.m. on April 4, no blame being attachable to anyone."

### Closing the Business

In 1921 Berl closed the business and both the house and shop were dismantled. Everything, including the remaining stock was brought to Perth and delivered to a vacant block adjoining the Broken Hill Hotel (then managed by [Morrie Hoffman](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman)) in Albany Highway, Victoria Park. After a couple of weeks it was all auctioned off. In the meantime Berl took over the license of Stirling Arms Hotel at Guildford.
