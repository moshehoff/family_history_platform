## Berl's Perth Years (1909-1913)

### First Child and Return to Perth

In 1909 their first child [Mina](/profiles/Minnie-Mina-Mendelovitz-Hochman) was born there. In 1910 the family left the Wickepin farm and returned to Perth. On his return to Perth, Berl immediately started work at Gallop Gardens on the Swan River foreshore in Nedlands. The family resided on the property.

The cultural heritage significance of Gallop House is determined by its historical background and its physical characteristics.

James Gallop I (1811 - 1880) arrived in the Swan River Colony on 6 October 1829 aboard the Lotus with his brothers Richard and Edward.

He married Elizabeth Spencer on 19th October 1843 and they had 12 children. They lived in a cottage on the foreshore where they farmed an orchard, vegetable garden and vineyard. In the 1870s James Gallop I and his son (James Gallop II) built Gallop House on his land for occupation by his son following his marriage to Emma Woods of Fremantle.

In 1896 Gallop Garden became less viable as a market garden due to the larger numbers of Chinese re-settling in Perth following the declination of prosperity in the goldfields. They were able to produce their produce at cheaper prices. The entire property was purchased by the government on the 5th May 1911 by which time the land had become more valuable than the market garden and vineyard.

N.B. Gallop House in Dalkeith (sic) has been registered as a heritage place.
