## Berl's Hotel Years (1921-1925)

### Stirling Arms Hotel

During the short time he and family were at the Stirling Arms it became known that Reginald Paget, a man from the Army Remount Depot in South Guildford was operating as a starting price bookmaker from the billiard saloon. This led to Berl's downfall.

### The Legal Case

On 19.7.1921 Berl was charged in the in the Midland Junction Police Court with "Illegal Betting on Licensed Premises". He may have been become the first publican to be charged with such an offence. He was fined eighty pounds, and had to pay his barrister's fee. Because the fine was so outrageous for the time, the barrister informed the magistrate that he would be appealing, however Berl said "no, it has cost me enough already".

80 pounds in 1921 was equivalent to 5455 dollars in 2010.

N.B. The family had been in similar trouble just a month earlier:

On 21.6.1921 [Morrie Hoffman](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman) appeared in the Perth Police Court with having "knowingly suffered gambling to take place on his premises (The Broken Hill Hotel)". Mr M.G. Lavan appeared for the defendant. The prosecution failed.

On 9.10.1921 Morrie Hoffman was fined 50 pounds at the Perth Police Court for having permitted his premises – the hotel – to be used as a common betting house.

50 pounds in 1921 was equivalent to 3410 dollars in 2010.

Later on, in 1923 when he applied for the Esplanade Hotel license, the Police challenged him – unsuccessfully - with this, and other convictions.
