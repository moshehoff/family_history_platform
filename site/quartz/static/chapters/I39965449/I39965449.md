## Berl Hochman Hoffman Introduction

This account is based on the biography written by his son Bruce. It includes my corrections of erroneous material.

[Berl](/profiles/Berl-Hochman) was just a year younger than my grandfather [Moshe](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman). So from 1885 'til 1890 they must have played together in Savran.
