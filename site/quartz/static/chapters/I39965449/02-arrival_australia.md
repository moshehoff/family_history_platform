## Berl's Arrival in Australia (1904-1907)

### The Journey

Berl sailed from Port Said on the Norddeutscher ship Stuttgart and landed at Fremantle on 24.8.1904. On arrival he changed his name to Hoffman, and learned English, which he eventually spoke without an accent.

### First Jobs

His first job was with David Bloomfield a fruiterer in Southern Cross. After about 12 months he returned to Perth and got a job with the firm Silbert and Sharp that was a major fruit provisioner from Kalgoorlie to Leonora in the eastern goldfields.

David Bloomfield (1877-1943) was the father of Gordon and his sibs.

Abraham Silbert and Joseph Sharp had a fruiterers partnership in Broken Hill, NSW. They came to Western Australia in 1894 and continued business, very successfully, in that line.

Berl's naturalization application states that he resided "between Leonora and Lawlers". This job lasted about 2 years.

Leonora is a town in the goldfields of Western Australia, located 518 miles northeast of Perth, and 147 miles north of the city of Kalgoorlie. The Leonora area was first explored by [John Forrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forrest), who visited the area in 1869.

In 1894, gold was discovered in the area by a prospector named Morrisey, and in the following two years a number of rich finds resulted in rapid development of the area. The Gwalia and Sons of Gwalia gold mines brought Leonora to the attention of the world. By 1897 a residential and business area had been established, and the town was gazetted as Leonora in 1898.

Wickepin is a town in the wheatbelt region of Western Australia, 133 miles south-east of Perth and 24 miles east of Narrogin.
