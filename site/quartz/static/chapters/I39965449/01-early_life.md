## Berl's Early Life and Palestine Years (1885-1904)

### Early Life in Savran

Berl Hochman was born on 11.4.1885 in Savran in Podolia. His father [Shimon Me'ir Hochman](/profiles/Shimon-Meir-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8-Hochman), mother [Bracha](/profiles/Bracha-Hochman), with Berl and his younger brother [Hershl](/profiles/Hershl-Hochman) left by the port of Odessa for Ottoman Palestine in 1890. 

Bracha died on the way.

### Sarafand al'Amar and Rishon leZion

Shimon settled at Sarafand al'Amar near Ramla.

He worked for [Baron Edmond de Rothschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_James_de_Rothschild) at the winery in Rishon leZion. The baron paid to send Berl to the agricultural school, Mikve Yisrael near Jaffa, which the baron himself generously supported. Mikve Yisrael was part of the Alliance Israelite foundation, and lessons were in the French language.

### Egypt

After Berl qualified he was sent in the baron's employ to Egypt where he stayed several months, whereupon he decided to go to Australia where his uncle [Haym Yudl Hoffman](/profiles/Haim-Yehuda-Hoffman) was established.

I believe it more likely that Berl was in Egypt to work in the Alliance's school in Cairo or Alexandria, than for the Baron himself. (Peter).

### Decision to Emigrate

[Haym](/profiles/Haim-Yehuda-Hoffman) had a small fruiterer's business in Wellington St., Perth. The Baron said he was interested in buying land in Australia and asked Berl to report back to him if there was arable land. Berl returned to Palestine and made arrangements to go to Western Australia.
