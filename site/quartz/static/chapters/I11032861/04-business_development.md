**THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN, PERTH 3.9.1907**

### QUARTERLY LICENSING COURTS

Monday, September 2. Perth.

(Before Messrs. A.S.Roe, P.M. (chairman) and Lieut.-Colonel Haynes and Rice Saunders J's.P.).

Colonial Wine Licences.

Hyam Hoffman applied for a colonial wine licence for premises where he carried on a fruiterer's business at 495 Wellington-street. Mr H. P. Downing appeared on behalf of the applicant; Mr A. F. Abbott opposed on behalf of several ratepayers; and Sub-inspector Lappin on behalf of the police on the ground that the premises were not suitable, and the licence was not required.

The applicant said that he did a fruit trade of 50 to 70 pounds weekly, and his premises were suitable for the wine trade, being in a good situation. The shop was 17 ft. by 13 ft. There was plenty of accommodation for selling wine by the glass, but he would mainly depend on the bottle trade.

Mathieson H. Jacoby, a member of the Winegrowers' Association, appealed to the Bench on behalf of the Association to grant all applications for colonial wine licences if the applicants were respectable. There was keen competition with the wines of the Eastern States since Federation, and the colonial wine licences were the main outlets for locally-grown products.

Sub-inspector Lappin asked if people could tell the difference between Victorian, South Australian and local wines. He had reliable information that a number of holders of colonial wine licences sold more South Australia and Victorian wine than local, the labels being removed so that a customer would not know what he was getting.

Mr. Jacoby said that he could not answer the question. He believed that the local wines were put aside for Eastern wines. His association did not believe that a man should be allowed to hold both a colonial wine and gallon licence.

The licence was granted. Mr. Roe remarking that if any person were caught selling other than Western Australian wine when the holder of a colonial wine licence, that person's licence would be cancelled.

### Comments:

Prior to Federation Western Australia was a "protectionist state" and slapped Eastern States wines with heavy taxes. The Federation was free-trade, and from the discussion in court it is clear that the colonial licences were a protectionist device.

[Augustus Sanford Roe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_Roe), Police Magistrate was the eighth son of [John Septimus Roe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Septimus_Roe) who was the seventh son of James Roe. John was a very important figure in Australian, and in WA history, as an explorer and Surveyor General. Augustus also had a colourful career – in Malaya, Broome and Roebourne and in later life as a Magistrate in Perth. For better and for worse our family had a lot of run-ins before him, and the records show that he was a just and compassionate man.

Next, Hyam moved out of his premises at the Globe Hotel, and opened a licensed restaurant, THE RAILWAY FRUIT & WINE PALACE, at 507 Wellington St.

This was on the eastern corner of Wellington and William Sts.
