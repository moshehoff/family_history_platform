## Arrival of Israel Hochman and Business Expansion (1907-1909)

On the 7th December 1907, [Israel Hochman](/profiles/Yisrael-Hochman), Haim Yudl's youngest brother joined him and [Berl](/profiles/Berl-Hochman) in Perth. According to his testimony on his passport application, Israel had sailed from Port Said on the Norddeutscher ship Gneisenau and had disembarked at Fremantle "as Joseph Birch on my Passport." He was then a nineteen year-old which explains why he left Russia on false papers. The passenger manifest of the Gneisenau does not have a Joseph Birch, so this confession has not yet been verified.

In Russia there was a compulsory draft for eighteen year-olds. At the time an elder brother brother, [Moishe](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman) was serving in the Russian Far East (and about that time his discharge was arbitrarily delayed) so clearly Israel was on the run. Israel went to work as a fruiterer with Hyam.

### A Recherche Restaurant

The Railway Fruit and Wine Palace, next door to the office of the " Sunday Times," in Wellington-street, is one of the most elegantly appointed establishments of its class. When granting the proprietor, Mr. H. Hoffman, his license, recently, for the wine saloon, Mr. A. S. Roe, chairman, of the Licensing Bench, remarked : "Yes, I know you and your establishment. Hoffman, and I can speak highly of both. You conduct your business on excellent lines, and your cafe is a credit to you." Mr. Hoffman's supplies of fruit are drawn from the best orchards in the State, and his stock of colonial wines is one of the most comprehensive in the city. It Includes several well-known brands, besides F. and C. Piesse's, Santa Rosa, Derrynasura Vineyard (Sir Arthur Stepney) and Houghton's, all of which are top-notchers in the very first flight. Mr. Hoffman is thoroughly conversant with the wine business, for he has been both vigneron and wine-maker in his time, and he has forgotten more about the game than plenty of people in the Bacchanal biz. ever learnt, or are ever likely to acquire, unless they live to the fine old fruity age attained by the late Mr. Methusaleh.

### Notes:

Mount Nasura is a suburb in the City of Armadale, situated 25km from Perth. It derives its name from "Derrynasura", a vineyard established in the area in 1897. It comprised 280 acres with cellars especially excavated into the hillside.

The Derrynasura referred to was a port wine.

Constantia, or vin de Constance, was a South African dessert wine. It was made from Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains (Muscat de Frontignan) grapes grown in the district of Constantia, south of Cape Town. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was widely exported to Europe. However, production of Constantia ceased in the late nineteenth century following the devastation of South African vineyards by the phylloxera epidemic.

### SUNDAY TRADING

COLONIAL WINE LICENSEES CHARGED.

FINES IMPOSED.

At the Perth Police Court yesterday before Messrs. A. S. Roe P.M., and A.G.Russel J.P., Hyam Hoffman was charged with selling a glass of wine on Sunday, November 8, and also with allowing a female to serve liquor on a Sunday. Joseph Brown stated that on Sunday evening last he went into defendant's shop about 8 o'clock. He sat at a table and asked for a glass of wine. This was supplied, along with a piece of bread and a German sausage. Constables O'Donaghue and Houston then came in, and asked a girl who had served him, what he (witness) had asked for. She said that witness has ordered lunch. He had paid 3d. for the wine. He denied asking her for the bread and sausage, and the girl then said that it must have been another man in the room. The defence was that Brown had asked for the wine and was told that wine was not sold, but that they sold a lunch and gave the wine with it. Mr Roe said that the Bench had come to the conclusion that the meal was a sham, a device, and a fraud to encourage the sale of liquor. They found the defendants guilty on both charges.

Isaac Gunzberg was also charged with selling a glass of wine on Sunday. The evidence was somewhat similar to that given against Hoffman, the complainant being supplied with a glass of wine, and four oysters and a piece of bread and butter. In this case also the Bench held that the meal was a sham.

Each of the defendants held an eating and boarding house licence.

Sergeant Thomas contended that according to the Act the holder of a colonial wine licence and an eating-house licence could not sell wine on a Sunday, no matter what sort of meal was served.

Mr. Roe held that the argument of the Sergeant was good. Holders of colonial wine licences were different entirely from licensees of an hotel, a wine and beer saloon or a way-side house. In these a bone-fide traveller was bound to be supplied with liquor if he asked for it. If the same person went into a colonial wine saloon or eating-house and asked to be supplied with the best meal available, that would not permit of a glass of wine being sold. Each of the defendants was fined one pound, with costs, for selling the wine, the police not asking for a heavy penalty. They being anxious to stop the sale of wine on a Sunday. For employing a female on a Sunday Hoffman was cautioned and ordered to pay the costs.

**SUNDAY TIMES, PERTH 7.3.1909**

A POLICE PIMPS'S FIELD DAY

Decent Tradespeople Spied on by a Stealthy Skunk

Who Incites Them to Break the Law - And Endeavors to Make Money by the Dirty Game .

Joseph Brown, police informer, had quite a field-day at the City Police Court last Friday, when, on information supplied himself, a number of small tradesmen were charged with breaches of the Early Closing Act, their offence being that of selling small quantities of cigars and cigarettes on the Holy Sabbath Day. Each of the offenders was fined 3s. and 2s. costs. . At the close of the first case, the police pointed out that Mr. Phizgig Brown, who had incited the defendants to break the law, was entitled to 8s. for witness's expenses. The bench consisted of Messrs. Brickhill, Duffell and Blurton, Js.P., and after a whispered discussion with his confreres, Mr. Brickhill replied : "We won't allow a farthing costs. If the police find it difficult to obtain convictions without the services of an informer, his fees will have to come out of the Consolidated Revenue."

Dutchy Perlstein, when informed he would be mulct in the sum of 5s., snorted : "If the dirty blagguard of an informer gets none of it, I'll donate five bob extra to the poor-box, your worship." (Laughter.)

Later on, Hyam Hoffman, Moses Wine, W. M. Robbins, and Joseph Ferstat were solemnly arraigned and charged, also on the information, of Phizgig Brown, with the awful crime of having sold a "bottle of colonial wine to one Joseph Brown (the dhirty informer referred to by Dutchy Perlstein) after the hour of ll p.m. on Saturday night week." Each of the defendants pleaded guilty, and was fined 30s. and 10s. costs, 8s. of which represented Informer Brown's reward for acting as an accessory before the act. The prosecutions were the first for this class of offence against the Licensing Act, and as all the defendants pleaded ignorance of the law, and considering the dirty and disgraceful manner in which they had been trapped by Phizgig Brown into fracturing the law, a nominal fine of a farthing, and a farthing costs, would have been adequate punishment for a most trivial offence. "The Sunday Tines" cordially compliments Messrs.. Blurton, Duffell and Brickhill on their peremptory refusal to allow witness's expenses to Mr. Informer Joseph Brown, and hopes the decision, will be regarded as a firmly- established precedent in subsequent cases of the kind.

So many rude remarks have been made by the "Sunday Times'' in relation to the custom of the Police Department in employing evil-minded calumniators of the scummy type of which informer Brown is an example, in inciting respectable business people to break the statutes, but we had mentally concluded the P.D. had decided to abandon this abominable method of securing convictions. The carrion crow can't change the color of its plumage, however, so the P D. doubtless still encounters insuperable difficulties in dropping its disgusting system of harassing and punishing people by the most infamous methods. As Sub-Inspector Lappin is in charge of the Metropolitan Police Force, we are probably right in concluding that that gentleman is officially responsible for the engagement of Mr. Joseph Brown in the capacity of spy and sneak. '"The Sunday Times" reluctantly confesses that the conclusion causes Mr. Lappin to sink several feet in its estimation. Mr. Lappin is generally, regarded as being so efficient, capable, and broad-minded an officer, that it was thought he could (and would) rise superior to the instinct of a mere policeman, and control the force with a reasonable regard to the exigencies of public decency. The employing of a skulking phizgig is a public indecency which should not be permitted by the Cabinet, (nor by Mr. Lappin). And if the ordinary force finds itself unable to cope with the small amount of crime perpetrated in the city and suburbs, its services should be dispensed with and a cadaverous mob of silver-hungry pimps and phizgigs engaged in its place. For the engagement of men of the degraded type of Joseph Brown is an admission of weakness, and a confession that the force is incompetent to perform its duties satisfactorily.

How mean and petty spirited is the official mind which considers it part of its duty to lay traps and snares for citizens whose only offence is that they attempt to fill a somewhat vicarious demand for cigars and cigarettes on the Sabbath Day ! Just imagine it ! Lappin and Co. take as much trouble to snare the inoffensive vendor of the Sabbath cigarette as they do to catch a burglar or a murderer in the performance of a crime punishable with death or a long-term of gaol. And while this dirty, low-down, and despicable prying on the practices of trades people is permitted to proceed is actually encouraged by the authorities scores of Chows in the city environs desecrate the Sabbath by digging and delving in their gardens, morning, noon, and hight, whilst the Wanneroo Road is dotted with cart loads of Chink-grown vegetables, making their way into the metropolis, so as to be in time for the early markets on Monday morning. Mr. Lappin's ideas of proportion are a bit awry. Apparently, according to his opinion, ¡it is a just and fair proposition to worry the soul-cases out of hard-working citizens and to permit the sleek and oily Chow to drive a coach-and-four through all the Acts in the calendar.

The engagement of a police pimp, and sneak should be simply impossible impossible in these enlightened days. The great majority of people have so keen a respect for the law that any official attempt to convert honorable men and women into quasi-criminals for nominal evasions of foolish laws should be scornfully scouted as a disgusting and repugnant proposition in the present temper of public opinion. The object of Mr. Lappin should be to PREVENT - not to CREATE- or incite crimes and misdemeanors. It is a very open question whether the engagement of Joseph Brown for the specific purpose of manufacturing police cases, and holding out special inducements to business people to evade the statutes, is it not an offence within the meaning of the Criminal Code. For Brown is an accessory before the act in such cases, and so is the official who engages, him for that particularr purpose, A few buckets of slops will probably cool Mr. Joseph Brown's avarice and ardor, whilst a strong reminder, from the acting Premier (Mr, Gregory) should induce Mr. Lappin to realise the error of his ways and conclude that his conduct in endorsing the appointment of a phizgig and sneak is unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.

### Notes:

Fizgig was slang for a police informer. The Sunday Times journalese form – phizgig - suggests a Greek origin. Likewise the spelling "dhirty" suggests a Sanskrit or Hindi origin for the common English word!
