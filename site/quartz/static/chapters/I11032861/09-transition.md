## Transition (1914-1916)

Hyam had intended that his brother [Morris](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman) take over the wine shop. Morris had to obtain a wine licence, so in the interim [Berl](/profiles/Berl-Hochman) was temporary licensee. The two were in some sort of partnership from February 1914 until March 1915. Sarah Hoffman, Hyam's widow had in some manner become the holder of the Australian Wine Licence.

Dated this 8th day of March, 1915.

All three of the above matters were handled for the family by Morris Crawcour. solicitor, at the National Mutual Buildings, St George's Terrace.

THE ESTATE OF HYAM HOCHMAN (usually known as HYAM HOFFMAN) was handled by Judah Moss Solomon, solicitor, at Surrey Chambers, St George's Terrace. The co-executor was Joseph Sharp, a president of the Perth Hebrew Congregation.

Subsequent to these agreements, and the licence transfer, [Morris](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman) was an independent businessman. [Boris](/profiles/Berl-Hochman) had his own interests in Westonia.

[Moshe](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman), [Tobl](/profiles/Tobl-Hochman-%28Hoffman%29-Zitserman) and little Harry had moved into the two family rooms at "411". Soon after, in August 1915, Tobl was delivered of a daughter, whom she named Bella after a grandmother.

About this time Australia entered the war, and railway station and the Port of Fremantle saw an enormous flux of soldiers passing through, and departing for Egypt on the frequent reinforcement transports. Trade at the restaurant and wine shop must have boomed, but there were problems with disorderly soldiers which made the headlines. The Wellington Street riots occurred on Thursday 20.1.1916.

**RIOTOUS SOLDIERS.**

**TROUBLE IN PERTH.**

PERTH, Thursday. -Riotous soldiers were again responsible for scenes in the city last night. The windows of a cafe in William street were smashed, and several fruit stands overturned. Later an attack was made on Hoffman's wine Saloon in Wellington street, and a shower of stones hurled through the window. A posse of police appeared on the scene, and charged the rioters, driving them to the railway station, where a general melee occurred. Several policemen and soldiers were injured. Reinforcements arrived from the police station, and, apart from a lot of bustling, no further acts of violence occurred. Two constables incurred injuries, necessitating admission to the hospital.

**SERIOUS MILITARY RIOT.**

Mob Attacked by Police. PERTH, January 20.

Riotous soldiers were again responsible for disgraceful scenes in the city last night. The windows of a cafe in William street were smashed and several fruit stands owned by foreigners were overturned. Tomatoes, apples, and apricots were freely pelted, and a number of the crowd were bespattered with ripe fruit, while others were assaulted. Later an attack was made on Hoffman's wine saloon in Wellington street, and a shower of stones was hurled through a window. A raid on the contents of the shop appeared imminent when a posse of police appeared on the scene, and, drawing their batons, charged the rioters, and drove them to the railway station, where a general melee occurred. Apart from much bustling no further acts of violence occurred. Two constables received injuries necessitating their admission to the hospital.

**PERTH POLICE COURT. (Tuesday. -Before Mr. T. F. Davies, P.M.) Wilful Damage.**

-William Turner, a returned soldier, pleaded guilty to having wilfully damaged a plate-glass window at Hoffman's wine saloon, in Wellington street. Corporal Fox related that about 6.30 p.m. on Monday he was near the Imperial Hotel and saw defendant standing outside Hoffman's saloon. Turner was announcing to passers-by that Hoffman was a German. Witness told him the man was a Russian, and advised him not to interfere with him. Defendant then walked away, but shortly afterwards returned. He remained in front of the shop until three other soldiers came on the scene, and then, picking up a stone, hurled it through the window. Turner had nothing to say to the Bench. He was ordered to pay a fine of £1, £12 7s. in damages, and 14s, costs; in default two months' imprisonment.

According to [Louise Hoffman](/profiles/Louise-Hoffman-Cohen), the shop front displayed the words "Boris and Morris", and Turner assumed that the ownership was German. She adds that William Turner was a New Zealand soldier.

From the same period, Louise Hoffman told me this story:

A policeman found Morris and some soldiers sitting behind the wine saloon imbibing alcohol. Morris was charged with an after-hours offence. His defence was that they were drinking lemonade. The magistrate knew that no self respecting soldier would touch the stuff, and he himself didn't swallow the story.

Arrival of Rivka Sisselman

[Rivka](/profiles/Rivka-Hochman-Zisselman) was sent from Palestine to be [Berl](/profiles/Berl-Hochman)'s bride. Mrs Swartz made the wedding frock and the couple were duly married in 1908 in the Perth Synagogue. Berl and Rivka then returned to Wickepin. In 1909 their first child Mina was born there. In 1910 the family left the Wickepin farm and returned to Perth. On his return to Perth, Berl immediately started work at Gallop Gardens on the Swan River foreshore in Nedlands. The family resided on the property.
