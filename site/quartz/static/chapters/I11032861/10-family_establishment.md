**FATAL SCALDS. DEATH OF TWO INFANTS. CORONER'S INQUIRY.**

At the Coroner's Court yesterday afternoon before Mr. A. W. Collett deputy coroner), inquiries were conducted into the death, at the Children's Hospital on April 23, of Bella Hofman, the 20 months old child of Mr. and Mrs. Hoffman, of Wellington-street, and Pearl Aurisch, the 12 months old child of Mr. and Mrs. Aurisch, of Victoria Park. Both infants died as the result of accidental scalding.

**Bella Hoffman.**

[Toba Hoffman](/profiles/Tobl-Hochman-%28Hoffman%29-Zitserman), residing with her husband. at 411 Wellington street, said that she was in the habit of bathing her child every day, and on the day in question she took the hot water into the bedroom and went into the kitchen for the purpose of securing cold water. She took the child with her, but it wandered away, and she next heard a cry from the bedroom. Hurrying there she found the baby standing in the water and trying to climb out of the tub. Her husband took it to the Children's Hospital, where it died a couple of days afterwards. Dr. Gordon gave evidence regarding the admission of the child to the Children's Hospital, and declared that death was due to shock caused by scalds. The jury returned a verdict that the infant came to its death as the result of shock caused by accidental scalding.

After sitting on the case of Pearl Aurisch, the jury added as a rider:

"in view of this being the second case of its kind within the last few weeks, more care should be taken by parents in leaving vessels containing hot water or other liquids within the reach of children."

On 27.4.1918 [Tobl](/profiles/Tobl-Hochman-%28Hoffman%29-Zitserman) gave birth to her second son Hymen Juda (by his birth certificate) at their home at 22-24 Monger St. He was named after his uncle Hyam who had welcomed [Morris](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman) in his adopted land, and who had "bequeathed" him such a good-going business that he too would be wealthy within about four years. Hyam's name was commemorated in the chosen names of other infants.

According to a newspaper notification in The West Australian of 1.4.1933 the property in Monger St. was registered in Tob'l's name.

I, Hereby Withdraw my Property, Nos. 22-24 Monger-st., Perth, from sale of all agents. (Sgd.) Mrs. T. Hoffman.

When she acquired the property, or whether [Morris](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman) had it transferred to her I don't know. Either way it was a device to limit his liabilities.

1914 [Sarah Hoffman](/profiles/Sara-Hochman-Bershada), with her three younger children ([Wolfe](/profiles/Wolfe-Hochman), [Rosa](/profiles/Rosa-Aron-Hoffman) and [Eli Aliyashiv](/profiles/Elyashiv-Hoffman-Hochman)) had returned to Rehovot, and their home on their land in Ezra Street. In November 1917 British forces entered Rehovot during their campaign to conquer Ottoman Palestine. The ANZACs who were stationed in the area were popular with the Jewish settlement. This amusing tale came to light during my research. The girl concerned was Rosa (then aged about 15 years).

### THE SOUVENIR.

What a tiny world we live in.

A few months ago, soon after the entry of the British into Jerusalem, the Australians found themselves quartered near where a lot of the inhabitants spoke almost perfect English, some of them quite so.

A warrior from Perth was invited to a Jewish home which was in almost every way a typical Anglo-Saxon residence In all but a few Hebraic placards on the walls, books of Jewish prayer in (Turkish, Arabic and Yiddish. This Jewish family was particularly attentive to the soldier from Perth, and hospitably entertained him. Would he like a souvenir of the visit and of the driving out of the hated Turk?

He would. But, being a sport, be stipulated that as he had already cast an eager eye on a small quaint Egyptian idol he should be. allowed to pay for it. The family wouldn't hear of it but asked him why he so much preferred the said Egyptian idol.

"It is so mystical," he said, "so unique, and so old-world."

The daughter of the house smiled. "Why," she said, "you may have it as a gift, but you could have bought one where we originally bought this." "Where was that?" he asked. "At Boan Brothers', in Perth," she said. It was the Hoffman family who for so long kept a fruit shop near the Imperial Hotel, in Wellington-street ! Perth.
