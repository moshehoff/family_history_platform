## Hyam Yudl's Historic Background


On the 1st of January 1901 the Commonwealth of Australia was inaugurated. Those were exciting times. The population and economy of Western Australia were growing fast after the gold discoveries of the early 1890's. The Jewish community of Perth was also growing fast, replacing Fremantle as the largest. There were also communities in the goldfields: Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, Leonora and elsewhere; and in Broome, Geraldton and other towns. A number of Jewish families arrived from Victoria where some already had business experience and capital. These were mostly Yiddish-speakers from the Russian Empire, which stretched from Estonia to the Black Sea. The turn of the century saw an influx of Russian Jews, either directly from European ports, or by way of Ottoman Palestine where they had sojourned for a few years.. There were Jewish agriculturists, prospectors and dealers in the country. In Perth and Fremantle and elsewhere, the poorest Jews earned their livings as hawkers, as bottle-O's, and rag- and- bone dealers Some of these had pawn shops, and loaned money. A number opened kiosks, restaurants, and sold fruit from stalls. There were Jewish fruiterers in the goldfields, and their contribution to the gold industry has not been recognised.

In 1893 three Irish prospectors, [Patrick Hannan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_Hannan), Tom Flanagan and Daniel Shea on their trek east were forced to camp overnight at Mt Charlotte, when one of their horses lost a shoe. It was the luck of the Irish, because they collected 100 ounces of alluvial nuggets over next few days . After Hannan registered the Reward Claim in Coolgardie on June 17 1893, the gold rush was on. Further south two other prospectors located further large gold deposits which the began the now famous "Golden Mile".

In just a few years, the Goldfields became the economic and political centre of Western Australia, when hundreds of mining companies were floated to speculate on the rich reefs. Men came from all over the world, often dragging their families in tow to the harsh outback climate. They were unprepared for the harsh conditions, and often carried inadequate supplies. Living in hessian or canvas huts with no sanitation and few medical supplies caused diseases such as scurvy, dysentery and typhoid also claimed the lives of many.

The Goldfields Water Supply Scheme supplied drinking water as far as Coolgardie, and did much to alleviate the threat of typhoid and enteritis. The problem of malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies required refrigeration – such as the Coolgardie safe - and fresh fruit and veges.

An advertisement in a Broken Hill (NSW) newspaper is astonishingly relevant.
The format is of direct speech between two miners. One, debilitated, receives advice from his mate about a sure-fix cure and remedy.

The 27 year-old Abraham Silbert arrived in Melbourne on the ship Yarra in 1886. He was born in Bialystok, Poland, and gave his occupation as "traveller".

The word is a euphemism for pedlar or hawker. His knowledge of nutrition and his presentation in this advertisement is remarkable for one who could not have had a formal education in biology.

**3.1.1894 The Barrier Miner**

CONVERSATION.

HARRY : I do feel bad, George. I bought some fruit last night down the street and it did not agree with me.. Oh, my. I am bad !

GEORGE: Why didn't you take my advice and go to Silbert's? He always keeps good fruit. You can't beat it.

HARRY : Well, I was going there, but I was too lazy to go up so far, and it just serves me right.

GEORGE : Well there is no better remedy than a good feed of good fruit to cure you, so we'll go to Silbert's and have some of the genuine article.

FRUIT. Lollies. Confectionery, and Cool drinks for all.

Note the address : A. SILBERT, opposite The Barrier Mines Office, Argent-Street.

**Silbert and Sharp 1907 Sunday Times, Perth.**

No better-known firm of fruit importers exists in West Australia, than that of Silbert and Sharp, whose shops and branch establishments extend to the back regions of the fields. The way-back miner or prospector at Laverton, can obtain the firm's choice fruits equally as well as the Perth or Fremantle residents. in every gold- fields town may be seen the familiar sign of the firm, over a well-appointed shop, in which the choicest fruits are daintily displayed, whilst in Adelaide, Melbourne and Broken Hill, operations are also carried on. Within the past week Silbert and Sharp report heavy shipments of cherries, peaches, apricots, plums, gooseberries, bananas and oranges from all parts, and many extra hands are up to their eyes in the work of packing and forwarding these dainties to all parts of the Golden West.

The Jewish fruiterers, among them Maurice Spigl and David Bloomfield at Coolgardie, Joseph Sharp and Abraham Silbert in various centres to the north, and Berl Hoffman at Westonia were instrumental in bringing vitamins to the arid outback.

Berl brought not only fresh fruit from the coast, but also fish and ice; and he prepared cool drinks (cordials) for sale in his store – prophylaxis for scurvy, goitre and food poisoning! The development of the goldfields might be said to have been "riding on the Jewish fruiterers' backs".

The more successful applied for liquor licenses and made handsome profits. They might then become publicans or hotel owners. The eating house and liquor licenses were strictly regulated. An applicant had to be a naturalized citizen, of good character without criminal record. He had to publish his application in a newspaper and appear before a panel of magistrates, where his application could be challenged. The colonial liquor license, a protectionist device, permitted the sale of Western Australian wine. The newly decreed Australian liquor license permitted the import, wholesale and retail of wine and spirits from the other former colonies. As we shall see, this was a jealously prized license which enriched the licensee. He might then become a publican. These people were supportive of their co-religionists, worked hard to establish themselves in Australia, and to bring out their families and friends. A dominant theme of this narrative is the assistance that this generation freely gave one to the other. In many cases this concerned family members, however it is clear that the Hoffman family had guides and mentors whose path they followed in business. Their first employers and partners in business were their fellows.

The Hoffman family's first friends, employers, partners and mentors were Yiddish- speaking Jews from Eastern Europe. Many of them had come to Australia after some years in Palestine, some directly from Poland, Russia and Galicia (Austrian Empire).

Quite a number had lived and worked in Victoria and New South Wales, but came to Western Australia in after 1893, in the gold rush.

Our family quickly fell in with the Jewish fruiterers in Perth and the country towns and learned the business. The next step up often was to apply for an eating house licence, and later for a gallon or wine licence.

Their dealings were contracted in Yiddish, sealed with a handshake and honoured. But unfortunately they left almost no personal written records. However the public record shows their addresses and license applications as fruiterers and wine shop operators and publicans. As publicans they were very much in the public eye, and were expected to donate to charities (Jewish and non-Jewish), host events, lead respectable lives and be convivial. The daily newspapers have yielded the paper trail that they themselves neglected to provide, and without them this narrative would be lean.

Beginning with Hyam, the family maintained close ties with other Jewish fruiterers who were successful in that business and others, and all very prominent members of the community. Two families merit mention: the Ferstats and the Silberts. I shall write some pertinent notes on them in an appendix. In addition, I am preparing some notes on others who contributed to the family's success: Augustus Roe, and the Beard family.
