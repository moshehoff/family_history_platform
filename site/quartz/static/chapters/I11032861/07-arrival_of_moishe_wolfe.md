[Moishe](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman) and [Tobl](/profiles/Tobl-Hochman-%28Hoffman%29-Zitserman) Hochman, and their nephew [Wolfe](/profiles/Wolfe-Hochman) arrived at Fremantle on the morning of April 25th 1910 as steerage passengers on the Norddeutscher ship Scharnhorst. It was the second day of Pesach.

G.M.S. SCHARNHORST. Only a monthly service is maintained by the vessels of the North German Lloyd on the Australian run, and consequently each outward bound steamer has a considerable quantity of cargo to discharge at Fremantle. Their stay therefore is usually more protracted that of the English mail steamers, and passengers are thus able to see more of the city and its surroundings. The Scharnhorst, which arrived from Bremerhaven, via ports, a few minutes after 11 o'clock, yesterday morning, has a fair number of passengers in transit, the majority of whom proceeded to Perth shortly after she made fast to the quay. She is still under the command of Captain Maass, who reported an uneventful voyage She was cleared to continue her journey to the Eastern states at 4 o'clock this morning.

[Morris](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman) and [Tobl](/profiles/Tobl-Hochman-%28Hoffman%29-Zitserman)'s first lodgings were at 426 William St., on the corner of Robinson Ave. behind the shule. Their home was a single room with a double mattress on the floor and a wooden crate on each side to sit on. Later Hyam added a few small odds and ends, including a treadle sewing machine, which to Tobl was a godsend. Within a few days Morris had a job in the trade his parents had put him to so early in life - wheelwright and coachwright - for Mr G. E. Grigg, coachmaker of Murray St. Nine weeks later he was sacked and he commenced work for Mr J.V. Sanders, coachmaker of Murray St. As a result of discriminatory treatment from the coachbuilders' union, he appealed to a workers' court. His brother Hyam came to court to stand by him and to translate the Yiddish. The hearing was on Friday September 30th 1910.

The report in the pages of The West Australian newspaper is here transcribed in full.

### COACH BUILDING INDUSTRY. INCOMPETENT WORKER'S PERMIT.

A case of interest to trades unionists was heard before Mr. A. S. Roe, P.M., in the Justices' room on Friday afternoon last, when a young Russian named Morris Hoff man, who had been refused an incompetent worker's permit by the Coachbuilders' Industrial Union of Workers, applied to the Police Magistrate under clause 5 of the Arbitration Court's award in the coachbuilding industry for a permit to work for J. V. Sanders, coachbuilder, of Murray-street, at the rate of £2 8s. per week, the minimum wage fixed by the award being £3 3s. per week. The applicant, who could only speak and understand English imperfectly, through his brother, who acted as his interpreter, stated that he landed in this State in April last and went to work for E. Grigg, Wellington-street, making cart wheels at 8s. #### per pair, and cart bodies at 7s. 6d. each. He worked there nine weeks, earning about £2 8s. per week. He was put off and then went to work for J. V. Sanders, Murray street, making cart wheels at 8s. per pair, and cart bodies complete with ironwork put on at 10s. each. He could make six pairs of wheels per week and a cart body complete in about two days, and owing to his not understanding the language and the different tools used here as compared to Russia, he desired a permit for such time as would enable him to acquire that knowledge. His present employer, Mr. Sanders corroborated his statement, and said his men had to spend much time teaching him, and he had also to provide him with some of the tools required. He was unable to use some of the wheels made by the applicant, through faulty construction, and he was not worth more than the amount asked for in the application. Mr. E. Grigg. called by Mr. F. F. Wilson, who appeared on behalf of the workers' union, stated he had employed Hoffman, and at first he had difficulty in getting him to understand what was required, and some of the wheels he had made were not up to standard, although he had used them. Hoffman got on better as bodies of carts. He put him off because a wheelwright in his employ with whom he could not afford to part had refused to work with him. Hoffman was a hard worker, and when he became familiar with any particular class of work was as expert as any journeyman. He thought that in a little time he would be a competent trades man. F. Buckingham, called by Mr. Wilson, said he worked with Hoffman at Sanders'. Hoffman made six pairs of wheels and started on the seventh pair the first week he was there, and had shown considerable improvement since then. He could make carts and sulkies as well and almost as quickly as other journeymen, and in view of the present demand for tradesmen he should be worth the minimum wage. He had no difficulty in making him understand what was required of him. He (Buckingham) was a bodymaker, and had a good general knowledge of, the trade, and in his opinion Hoffman was a good and quick worker. Mr. Wilson. in reply, contended that incompetent workers' permits should only be granted to aged or infirm workers, and not to such a fine specimen of manhood as the applicant, who, as the evidence in his opinion had disclosed, was well able to earn the minimum wage. Under the previous award of the Court, where piecework had been prescribed, the price allowed for making cart wheels was 15s. 9d. per pair. At that rate the applicant could, on his own showing, making six pairs per week earn £4 14s. 6d. per week, and he could make carts and sulkies almost as well as a competent body maker. Producing a copy of that day's issue of the "West Australian," he contended that it showed there was a great demand for wheelwrights at wages ranging up to 13s. per day. If the magistrate was of opinion that the applicant required further time to attain competency, that object could be achieved by the permit being refused, and the applicant apprenticing him ## to an employer for such term as would qualify him to obtain the minimum wage. That was, he believed, the intention of the Arbitration Court in regard to cases like the present, when they framed the present award. Permits. in the opinion of the union in cases like this, were undesirable as experience had taught them they did not advance the status of the worker, as employers having no obligation to teach them, kept them at any particular branch where in they might be the most profitable in consequence of which they were debarred from getting a general knowledge of the trade. The Police Magistrate said he was in accord with the apprenticeship provisions of the award, and also with the abolition of what was known as the improver system, but this being a special case and taking into consideration the applicant's lack of knowledge of the language, tools, and trade customs, he would grant him a permit for three months only, and he hoped he would make the best of that time to attain competency, as it would be no use his renewing the application to him at the expiration of that period. Mr. Roe therefore granted the applicant a permit to work for three months at the rate of £2 8s. per week of 48 hours.

The E. Grigg of Wellington St. appears to be an error. George E. Grigg was a coachmaker at 411 Murray St., across the road from Sanders'.

Morris worked for Mr. Sanders, at 429 Murray St.( on the south side of Murray St., a few little before the Milligan St. corner) for eighteen months and then for Mr. Beard, livery stables proprietor of Beaufort St. This appears to be Albert Beard, at 185 Beaufort St., opposite what would later be Birdwood Park.

On 12. 1 .1912 their first child, Aaron (Harry), named after a grandfather, was born in an upstairs bedroom at the Esplanade Hotel, on the corner of Marine Tce. and Collie St. in Fremantle.

[Morris](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman) was naturalized on 1.7.1912, when he took the Oath before magistrate Augustus Sanford Roe.

[Wolfe](/profiles/Wolfe-Hochman) was listed on the Scharnhorst's manifest as a labourer. His first known job was as a mill hand, from about February 1912 at Hoffman Mill in Jarrahdale. The original mill has been preserved and Hoffman Mill may be visited as a heritage site. In 1914 he was working at the Jarrahdale Mill.

His employment during his first two years in Western Australia is not known.

On 1.7.1912, together with Morris, he took the Oath of Citizenship.

On 20.3.1915 he enlisted in the AIF, and did his basic training at Blackboy Hill. He departed for Alexandria on the troopship Wandilla on 25.6.1915.

Wolfe's army service is recounted in a separate chapter.
