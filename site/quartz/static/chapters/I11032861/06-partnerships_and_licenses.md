## Hyam Yudl's Partnerships and Licenses (1909)

In February 1909, the Ferstat brothers – Joseph, Morris and Nahum - applied for Australian Wine Licences. They had entered the wine business during 1908. At the same time Hyam applied to upgrade his own wine licence granted in September 1907 to an Australian wine licence.

Obviously Hyam and his friends were capitalizing on an opportunity to enter more lucrative business.

Nahum was moving out of 411 Wellington St., and from subsequent events it is clear that Joseph was going to move out too, in favour of Hyam Hoffman.

Hyam was then living at 229 William St., on the west side of that street just a little south of Francis St. At some time since 1904 he had vacated his Roe St. home for a more respectable address. About October 1909 he moved his business to 411 Wellington St. and the family moved in there – into the two rooms which were part of the lease.

The Licencing Court records list the following applications:

1.2.1909 Morris Ferstat married, fruiterer and confectioner, residing at 428 William St. - shop and three rooms, applies for an AWL for WA wine, at 428 Wm.St. He has had a ColWL for over 12 months.

14.2.1909 Nahum Ferstat married, fruiterer, residing at 411 Wellington St. applies for an AWL for Victorian wine, at 763 Hay St. - shop and one room, and now licensed. He has had a ColWL for two months.

14.2.1909 Joseph Ferstat, single, fruiterer, residing at 411 Wm. St. applies for an AWL for WA wine, at 411 Wellington St. - a shop and two rooms.

14.2.1909 Hyam Hoffman, married, fruiterer, residing at 229 Wm. St. applies for an AWL for WA wine at 507 Wellington St. - shop and two rooms. and now licensed. He has had a ColWL for about 18 months.

23.5.1909 Hyam Hoffman, married, fruiterer, residing at 411 Wellington St. applies for an AWL for wines of WA and SA at 411 Wellington St. - shop and saloon, held by me under transfer from Joseph Ferstat and licensed to sell WA wines (i.e: AWL) and known as the Australian Wine and Fruit Palace. Hyam has held a ColWL for 18 months.

Hyam is applying to deal in South Australian (Barossa Valley) wines too! This licence wasn't held by many, and must have been the key to his subsequent fortune. His advertisements in the newspapers show that he was selling Hardy's by the case!

The premises at 411 Wm. St. where the family would reside was "a shop and two rooms", so it was certainly crowded, as he must have had his considerable stock somewhere, but the situation – right opposite the railway station - was ideal for both import and sales, as "country orders receive special attention".
