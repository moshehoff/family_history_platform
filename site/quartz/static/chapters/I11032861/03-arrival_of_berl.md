## Arrival of Berl Hochman (1904-1907)

On the 24th August 1904 [Berl Hochman](/profiles/Berl-Hochman), Hyam Yudl's nephew joined him in Perth.

Berl had sailed from Port Said to Fremantle on the Norddeutscher ship Stuttgart.

On arrival he changed his name to Hoffman, and learned English, which he eventually spoke without an accent. Hyam Yudl didn't employ Berl, but he must have recommended the young man to his fellows, because Berl's first job was with David Bloomfield a fruiterer in Southern Cross. After about 12 months Berl returned to Perth and got a job with the firm Silbert and Sharp that was a major fruit provisioner from Kalgoorlie to Leonora in the eastern goldfields.

David Bloomfield (1877-1943) was the father of Gordon and his sibs.

Gordon became an office bearer in the Perth Hebrew Congregation

Abraham Silbert and Joseph Sharp had a fruiterers partnership in Broken Hill, NSW.

They came to Western Australia in 1894 and continued business, very successfully, in that line.

Joseph Sharp became a president of the Perth Hebrew Congregation.

Berl's naturalization application states that he resided "between Leonora and Lawlers". This job lasted about 2 years. In 1907 he took up land at Wickepin and alone, by axe, cleared 150 acres, and commenced farming.

Leonora is a town in the goldfields of Western Australia, located 518 miles northeast of Perth, and 147 miles north of the city of Kalgoorlie.

The Leonora area was first explored by John Forrest, who visited the area in 1869.

In 1894, gold was discovered in the area by a prospector named Morrisey, and in the following two years a number of rich finds resulted in rapid development of the area. The Gwalia and Sons of Gwalia gold mines brought Leonora to the attention of the world. By 1897 a residential and business area had been established, and the town was gazetted as Leonora in 1898.

Wickepin is a town in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia,133 miles south-east of Perth and 24 miles east of Narrogin.

On the 17th December 1904 at the Perth Hebrew School Prize Distribution a child named Hoffman in Miss Esther Zukeman's class received a 10th award. There was a four way tie for 8th place so this was an eleventh prize! It is not clear which of Hyam's children this was, but whichever it was, he was a rather middling pupil.
