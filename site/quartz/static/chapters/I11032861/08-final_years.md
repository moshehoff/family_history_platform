## Hyam Yudl's Final Years and Challenges (1911-1914)

The following two passages are part of a much longer and humorous newspaper article. The Railway Fruit Palace was adjacent to the "Sunday Times" offices. Apparently reporters from the newspaper were Hyam's customers, and he gave them his opinion of an anarchist scare in Western Australia; and incidentally his opinion of the Russian legal system, and his own experiences of the pogroms of 1884.

**SUNDAY TIMES 20.8.1911**

### The Recent Arrests in the Country -Have the Police Found their Man?

-What the Authorities are Working on

-Twenty Foreign Anarchists Alleged to be at Large in W.A.

The sensational information which "The Sunday Times " published last Sunday, that a men who was suspected of being " Peter the Painter," a Russian of world-wide unenviable notoriety, was in Western Australia, and that a trio of detectives had gone into the Eastern agricultural areas for the purpose effecting his arrest was at first received with incredulity. But how reliable was our information is proved by the fact that while our printing machine was preparing our paper for the digestion of our readers, at the rate of several thousands an hour, the "suspect and another Russian had been brought to Perth by a late train, and were being quietly Smuggled into the lock-up.

Now with regard to the point as to whether either of the arrested men, Maren or Johnson, is identical with the mysterious " Peter the Painter," Mr. Hoffman, the well-known fruiterer of Wellington-street, furnished us with some interesting information. Mr. Hoffman regularly receives a Polish paper from Warsaw, and he states that about two or three months ago he read in it an account of the arrest at Warsaw of " Peter the Painter." Unfortunately he had passed on the paper to some other Russian to read, so that he could not give us the full text of what the parer said, but he states that it first gave the particulars of the arrest, and then the biography of the man. The latter showed that he had committed the most terrible crimes in Russia - burglary, murder, shooting, etc. " ' Peter the Painter,' " said Mr. Hoffman, " was not an Anarchist, and not a revolutionary. He was purely and simply an expert burglar, what you might call an international burglar -when he and bis gang had finished with one country they would take on another. His crimes were simply terrible."

We asked Mr. - Hoffman whether any of the later papers had stated what had been done to this remarkable criminal. "Oh, no," said he, "nothing has appeared since the arrest." But surely he must have been brou?ht bo fore some court ? we persisted. "You are not in Russia here," Mr. Hoffman replied. " In this country if a man is arrested he is brought before the court within 24 hours, but not so in Russia. There you may be arrested, and it may be five or six years before you even see the charge on which you were apprehended. I have a case in the Warsaw paper here in which a man was arrested in 1905, and he has only just been brought before the court and sent to Siberia. You have no conception of the difference between British and Russian law. Twenty-seven years ago I saw enough to prove to me that Russia was a pretty good place to get away from, and I have no wish to see it again."

This little interview with Mr. Hoffman shows that there is likely to be considerable difficulty in identifying either Maren or Johnson with the will-o'-the-wisp " Peter the Painter.''

Hyam's second son, [Aliyashiv](/profiles/Elyashiv-Hoffman-Hochman) was born at their home at the wine shop on 5.2.1911. [Rivka](/profiles/Rivka-Bar-Cohen-Hoffman), Hyam's eldest daughter married [Aahron Bar Cohen](/profiles/Aharon-Nissan-%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%9F-Bar-Cohen-Kaganovich) abt. 1912. The groom was a Kaganovitch, a cousin of [Lazar Moiseevitch Kaganovitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazar_Kaganovich) a leading Bolshevik who ultimately became Stalin's minister for industry during the Second World War.

Hyam's status in the community may be appreciated from the following note in THE WEST AUSTRALIAN of 15.7.1911. The choice of pallbearers was not a random matter. The others named were stalwarts of the community and respected men.

**FOUND DEAD IN GARDENS Perth, Jan. 16.**

H. Hoffman, proprietor of a Wellington-street. wine saloon, was found dead in the Government Gardens this morning about 8 o'clock. The keeper of the gardens noticed a man stretched on the grass in the enclosure, but, thinking him to be asleep, did not give the matter any particular attention. An hour later, however, when he saw the form in the same position, he made an investigation, and was shocked to find that the man was dead. He reported the discovery to constable McGowan, who summoned Dr Seed. Life was pronounced to be extinct, and the body was removed to the morgue. Subsequently the remains were identified.

The deceased, who had been suffering from heart trouble for some considerable time, left home shortly before 8 o'clock this morning, announcing his intention of goimg to the gardens to rest a while.

This afternoon Dr Seed made a post-mortem examination, but he could not give a certificate as to the cause of death. A coronial inquiry will, therefore, be opened.

The outcome of the inquest was reported in The West Australian on 10.2.1914.

My grandfather, [Morris](/profiles/Moshe-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94-Hoffman-Hochman), told me about his brother' death. He said that the ship was to sail on the morrow, and that he and Hyam had been conversing on a park bench in the Supreme Court Gardens. He took his leave from Hyam and walked off. After a while a man came running up and exclaimed "were you sitting with a fellow on the bench over there?.... he's dead." According to my grandfather, [Sarah](/profiles/Sara-Hochman-Bershada) and her children [Wolfe](/profiles/Wolfe-Hochman), [Shulamit](/profiles/Shulamit-Hochman), [Rosa](/profiles/Rosa-Aron-Hoffman) and [Aliyashiv](/profiles/Elyashiv-Hoffman-Hochman) did sail to Palestine the following day.

Hyam is buried at Karrakatta. His epitaph reads:

Hyam Yuda Hochman, lover of Zion.

This expression is a literal translation of Hovevei Zion.

Hyam leased the wine saloon, he was certainly not the proprietor.

The Supreme Court Gardens and the Government Gardens are one and the same. The main entrance was from the corner of Barrack St. and St. Georges Terrace. The gardens are behind the court building towards Adelaide Terrace and the Swan River foreshore. At that time the court building was a Jewish home! Joseph Hyman Myslis, who was caretaker of the building, lived there with his wife and children.
