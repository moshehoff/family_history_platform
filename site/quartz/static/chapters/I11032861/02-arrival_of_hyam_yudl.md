## Arrival of Hyam Yudl Hochman in Australia (1901-1904)

Hyam and [Sarah](/profiles/Sara-Hochman-Bershada), and their children [Rivka](/profiles/Rivka-Bar-Cohen-Hoffman), [Shulamis](/profiles/Shulamit-Hochman) and [Wolfe](/profiles/Wolfe-Hochman) travelled to Port Said and boarded an Orient Line vessel, the Austral, bound from England to Australia.

They disembarked at Fremantle on 20.2.1901.

A daughter, [Rose](/profiles/Rosa-Aron-Hoffman) was born in 1903. She was the first Australian-born child in the family. Otherwise the first records I have of Hyam Yudl in Perth are from 1904. He was a prominent member of the Zionist Club, and there must be more information about him in the Perth Hebrew Congregation records, but I have not searched them. His first employment is not known.

In 1904 the family lived at 200 Roe St. That address is just a little east of the Milligan St. corner. Until 1958 the north side of Roe St. from Milligan St. to the Horseshoe Bridge was Perth's red light district. Hyam's daily stroll to and from work would have taken him in front of all the houses.

On the 13th February 1904 Hyam applied for naturalization. He applied as Hyam Hochman of 495 Wellington St., and his occupation was fruiterer.

Hyam perspicaciously gave his work address, at the new and respectable Globe Hotel, rather than his ill-reputable-street domiciliary address. The latter was an indication of his poor circumstances at the time.

The Globe Hotel still stands on the block, and is now being restored.

The Globe Hotel was constructed in 1883 in a Victorian Italianate style. Its three levels of rendered masonry were fronted by a cast iron verandah that sheltered a bar on the ground floor, and hotel accommodation in the two floors above. The building operated as a public house until it was returned to the state in 2004 for the Metro Rail project. During 2009, work began on the repair and conservation of both the rendered and fair-face brickwork facades. The northern façade to Wellington Street has been fully refurbished with ruled ashlar render stone. This has been squared and laid in regular courses with fire joints. In accordance with both photographic and physical evidence, mouldings and timber window joinery were then reinstated and a new two storey verandah was created in cast iron with decorative patterns to match the original. The western and southern façades have also had their fair-faced brickwork repaired and conserved and a contemporary steel stair has been added to the southern façade to serve the buildings upper levels.

Attached to the application was a certificate signed by Frank Mahon, Officer of Police, to the effect that Hyam was is a person of good repute. On the 18th February 1904 Hyam took the Oath of Allegiance to His Majesty Edward VII. His heirs and successors according to law. SO HELP ME GOD !

The oath was witnessed by William Ardagh Gardiner Walter Esquire, Acting Police Magistrate Perth.

Hyam took his citizenship seriously. He worked long hours, and was diligently kept his work place hygienic and tidy. Not withstanding, later that year he had his first brush with the Law. He was hauled into the Perth Police Court on June 14th 1904 … and again met William Walter Esq. !

…... (before Mr W.A.G. Walter, Acting Police Magistrate) on a charge of Breaches of By-laws. - For having swept the dust and other rubbish into the gutter from the front of their shop windows Higham Hoffman, Samuel Ginsberg (and ten others) were each fined 1s. and 2s. Costs. The bench censured the municipal inspector for having stood by in many cases and watched the offence committed without making any attempt to prevent it.

The scene of the misdemenour was apparently the gutter in front of the Globe Hotel, and opposite the railway station. In the pre-motor age the streets were full of horses, and even more so in that broad portion of Wellington St. in front of the station. The fruit and vege scraps would have been well appreciated. The principle polluters were the horses.

…...and on August 5th 1904 Hyam was back in the Police Court.

<div class="citation-box">

(before Messrs H.G. Stirling and S. Hymus, J's.P.)

Early Closing Act. - For having neglected to close their fruit shops at 10 o'clock in the evening, Joseph Ferstat and Hyman Hoffman were fined 10s. and costs, and Morris Shpigal, Michael Tako?ski, Isaac Ginsberg, Solomon Silbert and Alfred Peele, 5s. and costs.

</div>

This episode demonstrates that the retail fruit business in the City was very much a Jewish affair. From the wording it is clear that Hyman Hoffman was already self- employed with his own store; and that Joseph Ferstat had another store. Morris Shpigal had previously been a fruiterer in Coolgardie.

He was the father of Hymie Shpigl who became the WA Government astronomer. Hymie married Anne (sister of [Louise](/profiles/Louise-Hoffman-Cohen)), a daughter of David and Rachel Cohen. Again we note the Gunzberg family in the fruiterers' business. Solomon Silbert was the cousin and brother-in-law of Abraham Silbert (who was in partnership with Joseph Sharp – Ted's family).
