GEDCOM Generation Marking Tool

This tool marks specific generations of descendants in a GEDCOM file with custom tags.
For each person at the target generation, it also marks their spouses, all descendants,
and spouses of all descendants.

SYNOPSIS
--------
    python scripts/gedcom/mark_generation.py <gedcom_file> <person_id> <generation> <label> [--output <output_file>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The mark_generation tool allows you to mark individuals in a GEDCOM file with custom tags
based on their generation level relative to a starting person.

Generation Levels:
    - 1: The person themselves
    - 2: Their children
    - 3: Their grandchildren
    - 4: Their great-grandchildren
    - etc.

For each person at the target generation, the tool automatically also marks:
    - Their spouses (all marriages)
    - All their descendants (children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.)
    - Spouses of all descendants

This ensures that entire family branches are marked together, maintaining privacy
for extended family networks.

Custom Tags:
    The tool supports any custom tag that starts with an underscore (_), following
    GEDCOM 5.5.1 specification for user-defined tags. Examples:
    - private, _PRIVATE, _private (all become _PRIVATE)
    - hidden, _HIDDEN
    - restricted, _RESTRICTED
    - custom_tag, _CUSTOM_TAG

    Tags are automatically normalized to uppercase and prefixed with underscore
    if not already present.

Duplicate Prevention:
    The tool checks if a person already has the tag before adding it. If the tag
    exists (even with different case), it will be preserved but not duplicated.

Output:
    By default, the tool creates a new file with "_marked" suffix (e.g., 
    tree.ged -> tree_marked.ged). The original file is never modified.

ARGUMENTS
---------
    gedcom_file
        Path to the input GEDCOM file (required)
    
    person_id
        Person ID in GEDCOM format (e.g., @I1234@) (required)
    
    generation
        Generation level (1=person, 2=children, 3=grandchildren, etc.) (required)
        Must be >= 1
    
    label
        Custom tag name (e.g., 'private', 'hidden', 'restricted') (required)
        Will be normalized to _LABEL format
    
    --output, -o
        Output GEDCOM file path (optional)
        Default: <input_file>_marked.ged

EXAMPLES
--------
    # Mark person @I1234@ themselves (and spouse and all descendants) as private
    python scripts/gedcom/mark_generation.py data/tree.ged @I1234@ 1 private
    
    # Mark all children (and their spouses and all descendants) as hidden
    python scripts/gedcom/mark_generation.py data/tree.ged @I1234@ 2 hidden --output data/tree_hidden.ged
    
    # Mark all grandchildren (and their spouses and all descendants) with custom tag
    python scripts/gedcom/mark_generation.py data/tree.ged @I11032861@ 3 restricted
    
    # Mark with tag that already has underscore
    python scripts/gedcom/mark_generation.py data/tree.ged @I1234@ 1 _MY_CUSTOM_TAG

FUNCTIONS
---------
    find_spouses(person_id, individuals, families)
        Finds all spouses of a person across all their marriages.
    
    find_all_descendants(person_id, individuals, families)
        Finds all descendants of a person using BFS traversal.
    
    find_people_at_generation(person_id, generation, individuals, families)
        Finds all people at a specific generation level, including their spouses,
        all descendants, and spouses of descendants.
    
    add_custom_tag_to_gedcom(input_path, output_path, person_ids, tag_name)
        Adds custom tag to specified individuals in GEDCOM file, avoiding duplicates.

RETURN VALUES
------------
    Exit code 0: Success
    Exit code 1: Error (file not found, invalid person, etc.)

Generation levels:
  - 1: The person themselves
  - 2: Their children
  - 3: Their grandchildren
  - etc.

For each person at the target generation, the tool also marks:
  - Their spouses
  - All their descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.)
  - Spouses of all descendants

The tool will NOT add duplicate tags - if a person already has the tag,
it will be preserved but not duplicated.

Custom tags:
  Any tag starting with underscore (_) is valid. Examples:
  - private, _PRIVATE, _private (all become _PRIVATE)
  - hidden, _HIDDEN
  - restricted, _RESTRICTED
  - custom_tag, _CUSTOM_TAG

Examples:
  # Mark person @I1234@ themselves (and their spouse and all descendants) as private
  python scripts/gedcom/mark_generation.py data/tree.ged @I1234@ 1 private
  
  # Mark all children (and their spouses and all descendants) as hidden
  python scripts/gedcom/mark_generation.py data/tree.ged @I1234@ 2 hidden --output data/tree_marked.ged
  
  # Mark all grandchildren (and their spouses and all descendants) with custom tag
  python scripts/gedcom/mark_generation.py data/tree.ged @I11032861@ 3 restricted --output data/tree_restricted.ged
